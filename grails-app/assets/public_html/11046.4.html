<br />
<br />
- non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa without features suggestive of rod-cone dystrophy/ cone-rod dystrophy<br />
- existing molecular confirmation of a diagnosis of Bardet-Biedl syndrome or another ciliopathy

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
- Genome-wide copy number variation testing (e.g. aCGH, SNP array or other genomic microarray)<br />
 - ARL6, ALMS1, BBS1, BBS10, BBS12, BBS2, BBS4, BBS5, BBS7, BBS9, MKKS, MKS1 and TTC8

						<!-- <h2>Bardet-Biedl Syndrome Phenotypes</h2> -->

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000510" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Retinitis pigmentosa</a></h3>
	Hereditary degeneration and atrophy of the retina.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Retinitis pigmentosa is a group of hereditary diseases of the eye. However, the term retinitis pigmentosa has also been used to describe the retinal findings characteristic of these diseases but also seen on other diseases such as Usher syndrome. It is preferable to describe the findings precisely if possible, but this term is kept for convenience.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000556" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Retinal dystrophy</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000483" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Astigmatism</a></h3>
	Astigmatism describes a refractive error  characterized by a difference in the horizontal and vertical  curvature of the cornea.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The irregular curvature associated with astigmatism means that the optical system is not symmetric about the optical axis. Most commonly the cornea is affected such that the refractive power in one meridian is less than that of the perpendicular axis. Astigmatism of significant degree causes blurry vision.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000486" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Strabismus</a></h3>
	Strabismus (also known as squint) is a condition in which the eyes are not properly aligned with each other.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cataract</a></h3>
	A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000648" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Optic atrophy</a></h3>
	Atrophy of the optic nerve. Optic atrophy results from the death of the retinal ganglion cell axons that comprise the optic nerve and manifesting as a pale optic nerve on fundoscopy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The diagnosis of optic atrophy is made when the optic disc loses its normal orange-pink color. Optic atrophy is an end stage that arises from myriad causes of optic nerve damage anywhere along the path from the retina to the lateral geniculate. Some of the most common etiologies are advanced glaucoma, optic neuritis, arteritic or non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy or a compressive lesion.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010442" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Polydactyly</a></h3>
	A congenital anomaly characterized by the presence of supernumerary fingers or toes.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001159" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Syndactyly</a></h3>
	Webbing or fusion of the fingers or toes, involving soft parts only or including bone structure. Bony fusions are revered to as "bony" syndactyly if the fusion occurs in a radio-ulnar axis. Fusions of bones of the fingers or toes in a proximo-distal axis are refered to as "symphalangism".<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Syndactyly may be partial or complete. In complete syndactyly, the skin is joined all the way to the fingertip. In partial (incomplete) syndactyly, the skin is only joined part of the distance to the fingertip.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001156" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Brachydactyly syndrome</a></h3>
	Digits that appear disproportionately short compared to the hand/foot. The word brachydactyly is used to describe a series of Mendelian diseases characterized by distinct patterns of shortened digits (brachydactyly types A-E). This is the sense used here, however, it is preferable to described the observed phenotypic abnormalities precisely.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001513" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Obesity</a></h3>
	Body weight that is grossly above the acceptable or desirable weight, usually due to accumulation of excess fats in the body. The standards may vary with age, sex, genetic or cultural background. In the body mass index (BMI), a BMI greater than 30.0 kg/m2 is considered obese, and a BMI greater than 40.0 kg/m2 is considered morbidly obese.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012758" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neurodevelopmental delay</a></h3>

	An abnormality of mental functioning including various affective, behavioural, cognitive and perceptual abnormalities.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000032" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of male external genitalia</a></h3>
	An abnormality of male external genitalia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010460" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the female genitalia</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000819" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Diabetes mellitus</a></h3>
	A group of abnormalities characterized by hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000833" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Glucose intolerance</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000873" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Diabetes insipidus</a></h3>
	A state of excessive water intake and hypotonic (dilute) polyuria. Diabetes insipidus may be due to failure of vasopressin (AVP) release (central or neurogenic diabetes insipidus) or to a failure of the kidney to respond to AVP (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001638" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cardiomyopathy</a></h3>
	A myocardial disorder in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal, in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease and congenital heart disease sufficient to cause the observed myocardial abnormality.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002564" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Malformation of the heart and great vessels</a></h3>

<br />
Comment:<br />
This category is meant to comprise congenital (developmental) structural heart defects.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000822" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypertension</a></h3>
	The presence of chronic increased pressure in the systemic arterial system.<br />

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003077" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperlipidemia</a></h3>
	An elevated lipid concentration in the blood.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hyperlipidemia is an elevation of the blood levels of lipids including primarily cholesterol, phospholipids and triglycerides and cholesterol esters. The lipids are transported on lipoproteins some of which are commonly used for clinical measurements, including chylomicrons, very-low density lipoproteins (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), low-density lipoproteins, and high-density lipoproteins (HDL).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000598" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the ear</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the ear.<br />
<br />

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000405" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Conductive hearing impairment</a></h3>
	An abnormality of vibrational conductance of sound to the inner ear leading to impairment of sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
A conductive hearing impariment with greater than 90 dB loss.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004452" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the middle ear ossicles</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the middle-ear ossicles (three small bones called malleus, incus, and stapes) that are contained within the middle ear and serve to transmit sounds from the air to the fluid-filled labyrinth (cochlea).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000388" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Otitis media</a></h3>

	Overlapping teeth within an alveolar ridge.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000218" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">High palate</a></h3>
	Height of the palate more than 2 SD above the mean (objective) or palatal height at the level of the first permanent molar more than twice the height of the teeth (subjective).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The measuring device for this assessment is described in (Hall JG, Froster-Iskenius UG, Allanson JE, Gripp K, Slavotinek A. 2006. Handbook of Normal Physical Measurements. 2nd edition. Oxford Medical, publishers). A high palate is often associated with a narrow palate. However, a narrow palate can easily give a false appearance of a high palate. Height and width of the palate should be assessed and coded separately. We do not recommend the subjective determination because this term can be overused and<br />
applied inaccurately.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001395" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hepatic fibrosis</a></h3>
	The presence of fibrosis of the liver tissue.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001397" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hepatic steatosis</a></h3>
	The presence of steatosis in the liver.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Steatosis refers to an abnormal accumulation of lipids within a cell or tissue.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011040" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the intrahepatic bile duct</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the intrahepatic bile duct.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002910" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Elevated hepatic transaminases</a></h3>
	Elevations of the levels of SGOT and SGPT in the serum. SGOT (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase) and SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase) are transaminases primarily found in the liver and heart and are released into the bloodstream as the result of liver or heart damage. SGOT and SGPT are used clinically mainly as markers of liver damage.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005341" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Autonomic bladder dysfunction</a></h3>
	Abnormal bladder function (increased urge or frequency of urination or urge incontinence) resulting from abnormal functioning of the autonomic nervous system.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001251" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ataxia</a></h3>
	Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- oder overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Ataxia can be differentiated into dyssynergy, asynergy, dysmetria (hypometria, hypermetria), dysdiadochokinesis, gait ataxia, truncal ataxia, limb ataxia, and dysarthria). Note: This term does not include sensory ataxia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001257" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Spasticity</a></h3>
	A motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes with increased muscle tone, exaggerated (hyperexcitable) tendon reflexes.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002251" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Aganglionic megacolon</a></h3>
	An abnormality resulting from a lack of intestinal ganglion cells (i.e., an aganglionic section of bowel) that results in bowel obstruction with enlargement of the colon.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Aganglionic megacolon is characterized by congenital absence of intrinsic ganglion cells in the myenteric (Auerbach) and submucosal (Meissner) plexuses of the gastrointestinal tract.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000458" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anosmia</a></h3>
	An inability to perceive odors. This is a general term describing inability to smell arising in any part of the process of smelling from absorption of odorants into the nasal mucous overlying the olfactory epithelium, diffusion to the cilia, binding to olfactory receptor sites, generation of action potentials in olfactory neurons, and perception of a smell.
