  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Those with systemic infections (unlike patients with classical hyper IgE syndrome)</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 - KMT2D (MLL2)</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004322" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short stature</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A height below that which is expected according to age and gender norms. Although there is no universally accepted definition of short stature, many refer to &quot;short stature&quot; as height more than 2 standard deviations below the mean for age and gender (or below the 3rd percentile for age and gender dependent norms).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001531" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Failure to thrive in infancy</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.

Comment:
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.

Comment:
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.

Comment:
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term &#39;psychomotor retardation&#39; is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.

Comment:
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000411" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Protruding ear</a></h3>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Increased height of the central portion of the eyebrow, forming a crescent, semicircular, or inverted U shape.

Comment:
Most eyebrows have some arch with downturning medially and laterally.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005338" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sparse lateral eyebrow</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Decreased density/number and/or decreased diameter of lateral eyebrow hairs.

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Reduced distance from the anterior border of the naris to the subnasale.

Comment:
This is often accompanied by a Depressed nasal tip but this should be assessed and coded separately. The term Absent columella has been deleted because a columella is thought to always be present, except in Single naris and Proboscis.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000437" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Depressed nasal tip</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Decreased distance from the nasal tip to the nasal base.

Comment:
This often accompanies a Short columella, Overhanging nasal tip, and Underdeveloped nasal tip, but these should be assessed and coded separately.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000175" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft palate</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Cleft palate is a developmental defect of the palate resulting from a failure of fusion of the palatine processes and manifesting as a separation of the roof of the mouth (soft and hard palate).

Comment:
Cleft palate is a developmental defect that occurs between the 7th and 12th week of pregnancy. Normally, the palatine processes fuse during this time to form the soft and hard palate. A failure of fusion results in a cleft palate. The clinical spectrum ranges from bifid uvula, to (incomplete or complete) cleft of the soft palate, up to (complete or incomplete) cleft of both the soft and hard palate.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001212" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Prominent fingertip pads</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A soft tissue prominence of the ventral aspects of the fingertips. The term &quot;persistent fetal fingertip pads&quot; is often used as a synonym, but should better not be used because it implies knowledge of history of the patient which often does not exist.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000028" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cryptorchidism</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testis in inguinal canal. That is, absence of one or both testes from the scrotum owing to failure of the testis or testes to descend through the inguinal canal to the testis.

Comment:
The gonad is mobile and can be retracted superiorly by the cremaster muscle reflex stimulated, for instance, by cold or touch. A retracted testis is not cryptorchidism. An abdominal testis cannot be distinguished by physical examination from an (Apparently) absent testis and requires radiological (or, rarely, surgical) procedures for assessment.</p>

Comment:
The anal canal is continuous proximally with the rectum and distally terminates with the anus.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003422" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Vertebral segmentation defect</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality related to a defect of vertebral separation during development.

Comment:
The vertebral column derives from somites, transient paired segments of mesoderm that surround the neural tube in the early embryo. The formation of the vertebrar involves many processes including resegmentation of the rostral and caudal regions of adjacent somites that then fuse to form vetebral elements. Disruption of these processes can a cause of severe segmentation defects of the vetebrae. The frequency of segmentation defects of the vetebra has been estimated at 0.5 of 1000 births. The range of segmentation defects includes left-right uneven formation of somites that results in hemivertebrae or wedge vertebrae. Incomplete segmentation can result in fused segments such as block vertebrae. A failure of the process of resegmentation and migration of the sclerotomal compartment can result in a failure of midline fusion, such as butterlfy vertebrae.</p>
