  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Chronic inflammatory bowel disease and inflammatory bowel disease like intestinal inflammation
- Age of onset intestinal inflammation less than complete 2 years of age.
- Histology confirmed intestinal inflammation with first endoscopy (less than 2.5 years of age).</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Acute infectious gastroenteritis/enterocolitis due to common pathogens (Rotavirus, Norovirus, Salmonella etc.)</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:

- In case of enterocolitis less than 3 month of age IL10, IL10RA and IL10RB signalling defects should be excluded.
- In case of enterocolitis with infantile diabetes and autoimmunity IPEX (FOXP3) should be excluded.</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100280" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Crohn&#39;s disease</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A chronic granulomatous inflammatory disease of the intestines that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus, causing a wide variety of symptoms. It primarily causes abdominal pain, diarrhea which may be bloody, vomiting, or weight loss, but may also cause complications outside of the gastrointestinal tract such as skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, tiredness, and lack of concentration. Crohn&#39;s disease is thought to be an autoimmune disease, in which the body&#39;s immune system attacks the gastrointestinal tract, causing inflammation.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012220" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Non-caseating epithelioid cell granulomatosis</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The presence of multiple epithelioid cell granulomas consist of highly differentiated mononuclear phagocytes (epithelioid cells and giant cells) and lymphocytes, not exhibiting caseation (a form of necrosis in which the tissue changes into a dry, amorphous mass said to resemble cheese).

Comment:
This feature is a hallmark of sarcoidosis.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A chronic inflammatory bowel disease that includes characteristic ulcers, or open sores, in the colon. The main symptom of active disease is usually constant diarrhea mixed with blood, of gradual onset and intermittent periods of exacerbated symptoms contrasting with periods that are relatively symptom-free. In contrast to Crohn&#39;s disease this special form of colitis begins in the distal parts of the rectum, spreads continually upwards and affects only mucose and submucose tissue of the colon.</p>
