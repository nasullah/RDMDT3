	A general term describing features characterized by abnormal development of bones and connective tissues.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The word skeletal dysplasia is most often used to describe a group of over 380 inherited conditions that involve abnormal development of bones and connective tissues. However, the word can also be used to describe the presence of a congenital defects of bones or connective tissues that are found in one or more of the diseases, especially on prenatal ultrasound, i.e., a situation in which it is often not yet possible to make an exact etiological diagnosis. This is the sense of the phrase we use in the HPO. It is, however, preferable to annotate the observed abnormalities.

	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002987" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Elbow flexion contracture</a></h3>
	A chronic loss of elbow joint motion due to structural changes in muscle, tendons, ligaments, or skin that prevent normal movement of the joints of the elbow.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003273" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hip contracture</a></h3>
	Permanent fixation of the hip in primary positions, with limited passive or active motion at the hip joint.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100490" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Camptodactyly of finger</a></h3>
	The distal interphalangeal joint and/or the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fingers cannot be extended to 180 degrees by either active or passive extension.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that some restrict the use of the term to inability to extend the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fifth finger. We do not restrict the term in this way. This term should not be used if the patient has Clenched hand. A similar effect can be created by radial angulation within the distal phalanx with thickening of the epiphysis, which is called Kirner deformity or dystelephalangy. The affected digits should be specified.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006380" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Knee flexion contracture</a></h3>
	A bent (flexed) knee joint that cannot be straightened actively or passively.

	A chronic loss of ankle joint motion due to structural changes in muscle, tendons, ligaments, or skin that prevent normal movement of the joints of the ankle.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003306" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Spinal rigidity</a></h3>
	Reduced ability to move the vertebral column with a resulting limitation of neck and trunk flexion.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001324" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Muscle weakness</a></h3>
	Reduced strength of muscles.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
It is important clinical to distinguish between muscle weakness, fatigue, and asthenia. Fatigue describes the inability to continue performing a task after multiple repetitions; in contrast, a patient with primary weakness is unable to perform the first repetition of the task. Asthenia is a sense of weariness or exhaustion in the absence of muscle weakness. Conditions that result in intrinsic muscle weakness can be divided into several main categories: infectious, neurologic, endocrine, inflammatory, rheumatologic, genetic, metabolic, electrolyte-induced, or drug-induced.

	Reduced strength of the distal musculature of the legs.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding can be due to peripheral neuropathy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003327" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Axial muscle weakness</a></h3>
	Reduced strength of the axial musculature (i.e., of the muscles of the head and neck, spine, and ribs).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000297" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Facial hypotonia</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001618" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dysphonia</a></h3>
	An impairment in the ability to produce voice sounds.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000467" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neck muscle weakness</a></h3>
	Decreased strength of the neck musculature.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003473" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Fatigable weakness</a></h3>
	A type of weakness that occurs after a muscle group is used and lessens if the muscle group has some rest. That is, there is diminution of strength with repetitive muscle actions.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This type of weakness is pathognomonic for an abnormality of the neuromuscular junction such as myasthenia gravis. A characteristic form of muscular weakness that worsens after use of affected muscles. Myasthenia is caused by  failure of neuromuscular transmission, which results from the binding of autoantibodies to proteins involved in signaling at the neuromuscular junction, including especially the nicotinic acetyl choline receptor (AChR) or, less frequently, a muscle-specific tyrosine kinase involved in AChR clustering.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003474" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sensory impairment</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the primary sensation that is mediated by peripheral nerves (pain, temperature, touch, vibration, joint position). The word hypoesthesia (or hyesthesia) refers to a reduction in cutaneous sensation to a specific type of testing.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term does not include abnormalities of cortical sensation such as two-point discrimination, stereognosis, and graphesthesia.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003687" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Centrally nucleated skeletal muscle fibers</a></h3>
	An abnormality in which the nuclei of sarcomeres take on an abnormally central localization (or in which this feature is found in an increased proportion of muscle cells).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Normally, the nuclei of muscle cells are located peripherally, immediately under the plasma membrane (sarcolemma).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004303" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of muscle fibers</a></h3>
	Any abnormality of the skeletal muscle cell. Muscle fibers are subdivided into two types. Type I fibers are fatigue-resistant and rich in oxidative enzymes (they stain light with the myosin ATPase reaction), and type II fibers are fast-contracting, fatigue-prone, and rich in glycolytic enzymes (these fibers stain darkly). Normal muscle tissue has a random distribution of type I and type II fibers.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Skeletal muscle fibers are cylindrical multinucleated muscle cells. This feature is meant to group abnormalities appreciated by histology, electron microscopy, and similar methods that allow individual cells to be visualized.

	An abnormality of the cerebral white matter.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding can be demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging, especially with t2 signalling. The cerebral white matter is the region of the central nervous system that  consists mostly of glial cells and myelinated axons that interconnect the various regions of the cerebrum and the lower brain centers. It is located in the subcortex.

	A congenital abnormality of the cerebral hemisphere characterized by an excessive number of small gyri (convolutions) on the surface of the brain.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Polymicrogyria, one of the most common malformations of cortical development, is characterized histologically by the appearance of an excessive number of small cortical folds, often fused together, with disordered cortical lamination.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003798" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nemaline bodies</a></h3>
	Nemaline rods are abnormal bodies that can occur in skeletal muscle fibers. The rods can be observed on histological analysis of muscle biopsy tissue or upon electron microscopy, where they appear either as extensions of sarcomeric Z-lines, in random array without obvious attachment to Z-lines (often in areas devoid of sarcomeres) or in large clusters localized at the sarcolemma or intermyofibrillar spaces.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding can be demonstrated by muscle biopsy, which shows nemaline bodies (rods) on Gomori trichrome staining.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003789" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Minicore (multicore) myopathy</a></h3>
