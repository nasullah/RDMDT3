  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Delayed or absent puberty with low or suppressed gonadotropins (including primary amenorrhoea, oligo/azoospermia with low testosterone. Bilateral cryptorchidism with micophallus is suggestive of congenital IHH)
AND at least one of the following,
Parental consanguinity, OR
One or more similarly affected first, second or third degree relative, OR
Syndromic features such as anosmia, cleft lip or palate, deafness, renal agenesis, neurological disorders

Individuals with severe or syndromic disease should be recruited according to standard guidance, typically as trios. Disease status of apparently unaffected participants should be determined according to standard clinical practice to detect cryptic disease.

In other cases, unaffected individuals should not be recruited. Recruitment in such families should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Acquired structural hypothalamo-pituitary disease
History of anabolic steroid use, recent history of glucocorticoid or opiate use
Severe intercurrent illness, anorexia, or other forms of undernourishment
Evidence of primary hypogonadism
Co-existent pituitary hormone deficiency
Features of Bardet Biedl, CHARGE syndromes, or other complex syndromes for which UKGTN testing exists</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice: 
No genes specified</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000458" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anosmia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An inability to perceive odors. This is a general term describing inability to smell arising in any part of the process of smelling from absorption of odorants into the nasal mucous overlying the olfactory epithelium, diffusion to the cilia, binding to olfactory receptor sites, generation of action potentials in olfactory neurons, and perception of a smell.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000823" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Delayed puberty</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Passing the age when puberty normally occurs with no physical or hormonal signs of the onset of puberty.

Comment:
The age at which delayed puberty may be diagnosed in a person without signs of secondary sexual development is 13 years in a girl or 14 years in a boy.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000786" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Primary amenorrhea</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008230" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Decreased testosterone in males</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000054" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Micropenis</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormally small penis. At birth, the normal penis is about 3 cm (stretched length from pubic tubercle to tip of penis) with micropenis less than 2.0-2.5 cm.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000028" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cryptorchidism</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testis in inguinal canal. That is, absence of one or both testes from the scrotum owing to failure of the testis or testes to descend through the inguinal canal to the testis.

Comment:
The gonad is mobile and can be retracted superiorly by the cremaster muscle reflex stimulated, for instance, by cold or touch. A retracted testis is not cryptorchidism. An abdominal testis cannot be distinguished by physical examination from an (Apparently) absent testis and requires radiological (or, rarely, surgical) procedures for assessment.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000027" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Azoospermia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Absence of any measurable level of sperm in his semen.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000798" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Oligospermia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Reduced count of spermatozoa in the semen, defined as a sperm count below 20 million per milliliter semen.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000204" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft upper lip</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A gap in the upper lip. This is a congenital defect resulting from nonfusion of tissues of the lip during embryonal development.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0410005" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft hard palate</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000185" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft soft palate</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Cleft of the soft palate (also known as the velum, or muscular palate) as a result of a developmental defect occurring between the 7th and 12th week of pregnancy. Cleft soft palate can cause functional abnormalities of the Eustachian tube with resulting middle ear anomalies and hearing difficulties, as well as speech problems associated with hypernasal speech due to velopharyngeal insufficiency.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000193" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Bifid uvula</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Uvula separated into two parts most easily seen at the tip.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000407" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sensorineural hearing impairment</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A type of hearing impairment  in one or both ears related to an abnormal functionality of the cochlear nerve.

Comment:
Hearing loss caused by damage or dysfunction of the auditory nerve (cranial nerve VIII, also known as the cochlear nerve).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001274" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Agenesis of corpus callosum</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Absence of the corpus callosum as a result of the failure of the corpus callosum to develop, which can be the result of a failure in any one of the multiple steps of callosal development including cellular proliferation and migration, axonal growth or glial patterning at the midline.</p>
