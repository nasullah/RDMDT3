						<!-- <h2>Inherited optic neuropathies Eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Optic atrophy occurring either in isolation or in association with other multisystemic features<br />
- Evidence of optic nerve dysfunction on clinical examination<br />
- Additional objective evidence of primary retinal ganglion cell dysfunction with optical coherence tomography imaging and/or visual electrophysiology performed to ISCEV standards

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Acquired causes of an optic neuropathy have been fully excluded with the relevant investigations, including neuroimaging<br />
- Optic atrophy secondary to inherited outer retinal disease

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
- Testing for mitochondrial DNA mutations

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000505" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Visual impairment</a></h3>
	Visual impairment (or vision impairment) is vision loss (of a person) to such a degree as to qualify as an additional support need through a significant limitation of visual capability resulting from either disease, trauma, or congenital or degenerative conditions that cannot be corrected by conventional means, such as refractive correction, medication, or surgery.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007739" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Mildly reduced visual acuity</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0200068" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nonprogressive visual loss</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000529" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Progressive visual loss</a></h3>
	A reduction of previously attained ability to see.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007924" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Slow decrease in visual acuity</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000575" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Scotoma</a></h3>
	Scotoma refers to an area or island of loss or impairment of visual acuity surrounded by a field of normal or relatively well-preserved vision.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001133" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Constricted visual fields</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000543" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Optic disc pallor</a></h3>
	A pale yellow discoloration of the optic disk (the area of the optic nerve head in the retina). The optic disc normally has a pinkish hue with a central yellowish depression.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Optic disc pallor can be judged clinically with serial color photographs or by comparison to the other eye. The pallor reflects replacement of dead axons by glial tissue. The loss of the small capillaries within the nerve accounts for the shift from orange-pink to white.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003380" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Decreased number of peripheral myelinated nerve fibers</a></h3>
	A loss of myelinated nerve fibers in the peripheral nervous system (in general, this finding can be observed on nerve biopsy).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding can be demonstrated by nerve biopsy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000508" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ptosis</a></h3>
	The upper eyelid margin is positioned 3 mm or more lower than usual and covers the superior portion of the iris (objective); or, the upper lid margin obscures at least part of the pupil (subjective).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000602" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ophthalmoplegia</a></h3>
	Paralysis of one or more extraocular muscles that are responsible for eye movements.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000649" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of vision evoked potentials</a></h3>
	An anomaly of visually evoked potentials (VEP), which are electrical potentials, initiated by brief visual stimuli, which are recorded from the scalp overlying the visual cortex.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The terms visually evoked potential (VEP), visually evoked response (VER) and visually evoked cortical potential (VECP) are equivalent.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007965" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Absence of visual evoked potentials</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.
