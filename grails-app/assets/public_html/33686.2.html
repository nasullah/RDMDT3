						<!-- <h2>Undiagnosed neurocutaneous disorders Eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
All of the following:<br />
1)	Abnormal skin pigmentation (café au lait pigmentation, or hypopigmentation, or both)<br />
2)	Affected individual has a family history of abnormal skin pigmentation in a first degree relative or is the offspring of a consanguineous relationship<br />
3)	Neurological phenotype in at least two of the family members who have skin pigmentary abnormalities (seizures or developmental delay or evidence of congenital abnormality on MRI scan)<br />
4)	No diagnosis after assessment by Dermatologist, Neurologist and Geneticist<br />
5)	No evidence of chromosomal abnormality on karyotype<br />
6)	No pathogenic mutations in the NF1 gene if the child is too young to definitely exclude neurofibromatosis type 1 clinically, and the phenotype could potentially be compatible with that diagnosis

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>


<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
NF1 as indicated above

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001000" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of skin pigmentation</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the pigmentation of the skin.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011509" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Macular hyperpigmentation</a></h3>
	Increased amount of pigmentation in the macula lutea.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007988" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Macular hypopigmentation</a></h3>
	Decreased amount of pigmentation in the macula lutea.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011354" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Generalized abnormality of skin</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the skin that is not localized to any one particular region.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000924" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the skeletal system</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the skeletal system.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000818" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the endocrine system</a></h3>
	Ab abnormality of the endocrine system.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The endocrine system is composed of glands that secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream and includes the following glands: thyroid, parathyroids, adrenals, pancreas, gonads (testicles and ovaries), and pituitary. Many other organs, such as the kidney, liver, and heart, have secondary endocrine functions.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001626" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the cardiovascular system</a></h3>
	Any abnormality of the cardiovascular system.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The cardiovascular system consists of the heart, vasculature, and the lymphatic system.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001999" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal facial shape</a></h3>
	An abnormal morphology (form) of the face or its components.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term now covers many of the historical inexact descriptions such as Bird-like facies that probably should be avoided in modern genetics. This portion of the Ontology should be revised.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
	A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002650" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Scoliosis</a></h3>
	The presence of an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine.
