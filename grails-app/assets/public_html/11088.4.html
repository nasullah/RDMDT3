						<!-- <h2>Early onset dystonia Eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Dystonia affecting any body part, usually spreading to involve multiple body regions (e.g. multifocal, segmental, generalised)<br />
- Age at onset <31 years or later onset with family history of early onset dystonia<br />
- May be paroxysmal/episodic dystonia<br />
- May be associated with myoclonus as in myoclonic dystonia

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Underlying cause for clinical syndrome identified, e.g. cerebral palsy, dopa-responsive dystonia, structural brain lesion, Wilson disease, psychogenic dystonia

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
- TOR1A

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000643" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Blepharospasm</a></h3>
	A focal dystonia that affects the muscles of the eyelids and brow, associated with involuntary recurrent spasm of both eyelids.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000473" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Torticollis</a></h3>
	Involuntary contractions of the neck musculature resulting in an abnormal posture of or abnormal movements of the head.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The word torticollis comes from Latin words meaning twisted neck. Spasmodic torticollis is a focal dystonia that affects the neck and sometimes the shoulders, leading to involuntary contractions of the neck muscles, abnormal movements and postures of the head and neck. The abnormal movements can have both tonic and clonic components and can results in pain and discomfort. Spasmodic torticollis is the most common focal dystonia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012179" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Craniofacial dystonia</a></h3>
	A form of focal dystonia affecting the face, head or neck muscles.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002530" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Axial dystonia</a></h3>
	A type of dystonia that affects the midline muscles, i.e., the chest, abdominal, and back muscles.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002345" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Action tremor</a></h3>
	A tremor present when the limbs are active, either when outstretched in a certain position or throughout a voluntary movement.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Action tremor occurs with voluntary contraction of muscle. Subforms of action tremor include postural, isometric, and kinetic tremors
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002346" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Head tremor</a></h3>
	An unintentional, oscillating to-and-fro muscle movement affecting head movement.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012049" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Laryngeal dystonia</a></h3>
	A form of focal dystonia that affects the vocal cords, associated with involuntary contractions of the vocal cords causing interruptions of speech and affecting the voice quality and often leading to patterned, repeated breaks in speech.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002451" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Limb dystonia</a></h3>
	A type of dystonia (abnormally increased muscular tone causing fixed abnormal postures) that affects muscles of the limbs.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012048" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Oromandibular dystonia</a></h3>
	A kind of focal dystonia characterized by forceful contractions of the face, jaw, and/or tongue causing difficulty in opening and closing the mouth and often affecting chewing and speech.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002356" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Writer&#39;s cramp</a></h3>
	A focal dystonia of the fingers, hand, and/or forearm that appears when the affected person attempts to do a task that requires fine motor movements such as writing or playing a musical instrument.
