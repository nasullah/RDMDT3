  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Clinical diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta based on the presence of childhood onset bone fragility (&gt;1 fracture and/or fractures associated with low impact trauma) 
AND one or more of: 
- Short stature (not associated with any other syndromal diagnosis) 
- Dentinogenesis Imperfecta 
- Blue sclerae 
- Joint hypermobility 
- Deafness 
- Facial Dysmorphism characteristic of OI/ bone fragility 
- Joint contractures with an unexplained genetic aetiology  
AND 
- Individuals with features suggestive of classical mild osteogenesis imperfecta (OI type I) who have not undergone prior genetic testing of COL1A1 and COL1A2 should be recruited initially as singletons. 
In families where analysis as a singleton does not lead to identification of the underlying causative mutation, recruitment of additional affected family members is encouraged.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Known genetic aetiology of OI
- Other syndromal short stature without bone fragility
- Secondary causes of bone fragility such as prolonged treatment with steroids;
cerebral palsy; reduced mobility contributing to fractures</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Clinical diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta based on the presence of childhood onset bone fragility (&gt;1 fracture and/or fractures associated with low impact trauma) 
AND one or more of: 
- Short stature (not associated with any other syndromal diagnosis) 
- Dentinogenesis Imperfecta 
- Blue sclerae 
- Joint hypermobility 
- Deafness 
- Facial Dysmorphism characteristic of OI/ bone fragility 
- Joint contractures with an unexplained genetic aetiology  
AND 
- Individuals with features suggestive of classical mild osteogenesis imperfecta (OI type I) who have not undergone prior genetic testing of COL1A1 and COL1A2 should be recruited initially as singletons. 
In families where analysis as a singleton does not lead to identification of the underlying causative mutation, recruitment of additional affected family members is encouraged.</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Tall head relative to width and length.

Comment:
Turricephaly is derived from the Latin word turris, meaning tall, and refers to a round, tall (tower-like) skull. This feature may have previously been considered to overlap with or include a tall forehead. Turricephaly is present when the head appears tall (subjective) and head length and width are reduced compared to normal age-related standards (objective). Head length is measured between the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) and the most prominent part of the occiput in the midline, using spreading calipers. Head width is measured between the most lateral points of the parietal bones on each side of the head, using spreading calipers. The term acrocephaly (or oxycephaly) is used when there is turricephaly and the top of the skull assumes a cone shape.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Projection of the tip of the dens more than 5 mm above a line joining the hard palate to the posterior lip of the foramen magnum (Chamberlain&#39;s line) or the tip of the dens is greater than 7 mm above McGregor&#39;s line (the back of the hard palate to the lowest point of the occipital squama).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002691" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Platybasia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A developmental malformation of the occipital bone and upper end of the cervical spine, in which the latter appears to have pushed the floor of the occipital bone upward such that there is an  abnormal flattening of the skull base.

Comment:
Platybasia is malformation of the base of the skull due to softening of skull bones or a developmental anomaly, with bulging upwards of the floor of the posterior cranial fossa, upward displacement of the upper cervical vertebrae, and bony impingement on the brainstem. It results in abnormal obtuseness of the basal angle that can be demonstrated radiographically. If platybasia is associated with basilar invagination, compression of the brainstem and upper cervical cord can result.</p>
