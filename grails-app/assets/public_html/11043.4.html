						<!-- <h2>RASopathy Phenotypes</h2> -->

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011968" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Feeding difficulties</a></h3>
	Impaired ability to eat related to problems gathering food and getting ready to suck, chew, or swallow it.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001531" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Failure to thrive in infancy</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001508" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Failure to thrive</a></h3>
	Failure to thrive (FTT) refers to a child whose physical growth is substantially below the norm.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Although there is no clear consensus on the exact definition of FTT, it is usually diagnoses in a child growing below the 3rd percentile or in a child whose decreased growth has cross two major growth percentiles (for example, from above the 75th percentile to below the 25th percentile).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002020" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Gastroesophageal reflux</a></h3>
	A condition in which the stomach contents leak backwards from the stomach into the esophagus through the lower esophageal sphincter.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001639" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</a></h3>
	Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is defined by the presence of increased ventricular wall thickness or mass in the absence of loading conditions (hypertension, valve disease) sufficient to cause the observed abnormality.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001642" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pulmonic stenosis</a></h3>
	A narrowing of the right ventricular outflow tract that can occur at the pulmonary valve (valvular stenosis) or just below the pulmonary valve (infundibular stenosis).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Infundibular pulmonic stenosis is mostly caused by overgrowth of the heart muscle wall (hypertrophy of the septoparietal trabeculae). Pulmonic stenosis is often seen as a part of Fallot' s tetralogy, in which case the events leading to the formation of the overriding aorta are also believed to be a cause of the pulmonic stenosis. The pulmonic stenosis is the major cause of the malformations seen in patients with Fallot tetralogy, with the other associated malformations acting as compensatory mechanisms to the pulmonic stenosis. The degree of stenosis varies between individuals with TOF, and is the primary determinant of symptoms and severity. This malformation is infrequently described as sub-pulmonary stenosis or subpulmonary obstruction.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001702" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the tricuspid valve</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the tricuspid valve.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001629" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ventricular septal defect</a></h3>
	A hole between the two bottom chambers (ventricles) of the heart. The defect is centered around the most superior aspect of the ventricular septum.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001635" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Congestive heart failure</a></h3>
	The presence of an abnormality of cardiac function that is responsible for the failure of the heart to pump blood at a rate that is commensurate with the needs of the tissues or a state in which abnormally elevated filling pressures are required for the heart to do so. Heart failure is frequently related to a defect in myocardial contraction.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011675" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Arrhythmia</a></h3>
	Any cardiac rhythm other than the normal sinus rhythm. Such a rhythm may be either of sinus or ectopic origin and either regular or irregular. An arrhythmia may be due to a disturbance in impulse formation or conduction or both.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001791" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Fetal ascites</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010878" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Fetal cystic hygroma</a></h3>
	The presence during the prenatal period of a cystic mass with multiple septa with multiple, asymmetric, thin-walled cysts near the posterior aspect of the neck. Fetal cystic hygroma can be defined as nuchal translucency with or without septations measuring greater than 3.0 mm.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Upon ultrasound examination, fetal cystic hygroma presents as a cystic mass with multiple septa with multiple, asymmetric, thin-walled cysts related to the posterior aspect of the neck. Cystic hygromas can range from increased nuchal translucency to thin-walled cystic masses that may become larger than the fetal head. The cysts may result from a lymphatic abnormality, possibly one caused by absent or inefficient connections between the lymphatic and venous systems. Depending on the site, the cut off may vary from site to site. Lowest would be 2.5 mm and highest 3.5 mm.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010880" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Increased nuchal translucency</a></h3>
	The presence of an abnormally large hypoechoic space in the posterior fetal neck (usually detected on prenatal ultrasound examination).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Increased nuchal translucency may be related to a cystic hygroma or to mesenchymal edema. Increased nuchal translucency can be classified into three categories: 1) cardiac abnormalities, combined with abnormal ductus venosus flow velocities, is found, leading to the theory that cardiac failure causes nuchal translucency enlargement; 2) various types of abnormalities are found in the extracellular matrix of the nuchal skin of fetuses with increased nuchal translucency; 3) abnormal lymphatic development is demonstrated in fetuses with increased nuchal translucency.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001790" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nonimmune hydrops fetalis</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000028" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cryptorchidism</a></h3>
	Testis in inguinal canal. That is, absence of one or both testes from the scrotum owing to failure of the testis or testes to descend through the inguinal canal to the testis.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The gonad is mobile and can be retracted superiorly by the cremaster muscle reflex stimulated, for instance, by cold or touch. A retracted testis is not cryptorchidism. An abdominal testis cannot be distinguished by physical examination from an (Apparently) absent testis and requires radiological (or, rarely, surgical) procedures for assessment.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100753" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Schizophrenia</a></h3>
	A mental disorder characterized by a disintegration of thought processes and of emotional responsiveness. It most commonly manifests as auditory hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions, or disorganized speech and thinking, and it is accompanied by significant social or occupational dysfunction. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in young adulthood, with a global lifetime prevalence of about 0.3-0.7%.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Positive symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations (especially of voices), are common, and any Schneiderian first-rank symptoms are particularly indicative of the illness. Negative symptoms include social withdrawal, impairment of ego boundaries, and loss of energy and initiative. Schizophrenia is diagnosed only if symptoms persist for at least one month. The illness can spontaneously remit, run a course with infrequent or frequent relapses, or become chronic. The prognosis has improved with antipsychotic drugs and with vigorous psychological and social management and rehabilitation. The many causes include genetic factors, environmental stress, and various triggering factors.

	Astigmatism describes a refractive error  characterized by a difference in the horizontal and vertical  curvature of the cornea.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The irregular curvature associated with astigmatism means that the optical system is not symmetric about the optical axis. Most commonly the cornea is affected such that the refractive power in one meridian is less than that of the perpendicular axis. Astigmatism of significant degree causes blurry vision.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008064" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ichthyosis</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the skin characterized the presence of excessive amounts of dry surface scales on the skin resulting from an abnormality of keratinization.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The ichthyoses are a group of skin diseases characterized by drying and scaling of skin with the accumulation of thick scales and cracks that may be painful or bleed. The abnormality in ichthyosis lies in am imbalance in the normal lifecycle of skin in which growth is matched with dying and shedding of skin cells. In ichthyosis, skin cells reproduce at a rate faster than dead skin cells can be shed or reproduce at a normal rate with a reduction in the rate of shedding. Either abnormality leads to a build up of dry and scaly skin. Note that this term refers to the morphological abnormality of the skin and not the disorder.

	An organ or organ-system abnormality that consists of uncontrolled autonomous cell-proliferation which can occur in any part of the body as a benign or malignant neoplasm (tumour).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies neoplasms into four main groups: (i) benign neoplasm, (ii) in situ neoplasm, (iii) malignant neoplasm, and (iv) neoplasm of uncertain or unknown behavior. A malignant neoplasm is also known as cancer.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000238" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hydrocephalus</a></h3>
	Hydrocephalus is an active distension of the ventricular system of the brain resulting from inadequate passage of CSF from its point of production within the cerebral ventricles to its point of absorption into the systemic circulation.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hydrocephalus results from an imbalance between the rate of production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), mainly in the choroid plexus, and its reabsorption in the subarchnoid space over brain and spinal cord.
