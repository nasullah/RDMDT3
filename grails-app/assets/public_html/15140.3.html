						<!-- <h2>Brain channelopathy Eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Episodic disorder that often causes a combination of ataxia with walking problems, abnormal extra movements, stiff legs, weakness, headache and nausea. <br />
- Episodes lasting a few minutes or hours. <br />
- There may be a dystonic component and some patients are exhausted for many hours afterwards. <br />
- Attacks are not always the same, even with the same genetic defect.<br />
- Arms can be affected like legs<br />
- Migraine type headaches are frequently associated as is dysarthria<br />
- Some patients have a primary headache in the form of hemiplegic migraine (FHM), cluster headache, SUNCT or SUNA<br />
- MRI brain and cord to exclude common causes such as tumours, discs, demyelinating causes<br />
- Family history of often present in AD or AR forms, X linked pattern rare<br />
- Often drugs such as Lamotrigine or acetazolamide are effective

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>


<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
- KCN1A, PRRT2 as appropriate<br />
  - CACNA1A (only in dominant, long duration episodic ataxia)

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002131" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Episodic ataxia</a></h3>
	Periodic spells of incoordination and imbalance, that is, episodes of ataxia typically lasting from 10 minutes to several hours or days.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002315" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Headache</a></h3>
	Cephalgia, or pain sensed in various parts of the head, not confined to the area of distribution of any nerve.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Headache is one of the most common types of recurrent pain as well as one of the most frequent symptoms in neurology. In addition to occasional headaches, there are well-defined headache disorders that vary in incidence, prevalence and duration and can be divided into two broad categories. In secondary headache disorders, headaches are attributed to another condition, such as brain tumour or head injury; for the primary disorders the headache is not due to another condition.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012199" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cluster headache</a></h3>
	A type of headache characterized by repeated attacks of unilateral pain lasting 15 to 180 minutes and associated with local autonomic signs.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
According to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II), the diagnosis of cluster headache can be made with at least five attacks fulfilling criteria B-D:<br />
B) Severe or very severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital and/or temporal pain lasting 15-180 minutes if untreated.<br />
C) Headache is accompanied by at least 1 of the following:<br />
(i) Ipsilateral conjunctival injection and/or lacrimation.<br />
(ii) Ipsilateral nasal congestion and/or rhinorrhea.<br />
(iii) Ipsilateral eyelid edema.<br />
(iv) Ipsilateral forehead and facial sweating.<br />
(v) Ipsilateral miosis and/or ptosis.<br />
(vi) A sense of restlessness or agitation.<br />
D) Attacks have a frequency from 1 every other day to 8/day.<br />
Additionally, the headaches cannot attributed to another disorder.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002076" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Migraine</a></h3>
	Migraine is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by episodic attacks of headache and associated symptoms.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100661" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Trigeminal neuralgia</a></h3>
	A neuropathic disorder characterized by episodes of intense pain in the face, originating from the trigeminal nerve. One, two, or all three branches of the nerve may be affected.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002018" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nausea</a></h3>
	A sensation of unease in the stomach together with an urge to vomit.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002172" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Postural instability</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000496" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of eye movement</a></h3>
	An abnormality in voluntary or involuntary eye movements or their control.
