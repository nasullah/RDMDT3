						<!-- <h2>Cockayne syndrome Phenotypes</h2> -->

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003510" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Severe short stature</a></h3>
	A severe degree of short stature, more than -4 SD from the mean corrected for age and sex.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term severe short stature is to be preferred over dwarfism, which has been used in the past to refer to individuals with an adult height under 4 feet 10 inches (147 cm).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000992" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cutaneous photosensitivity</a></h3>
	An increased sensitivity of the skin to light. Photosensitivity may result in a rash upon exposure to the sun (which is known as photodermatosis). Photosensitivity can be diagnosed by phototests in which light is shone on small areas of skin.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001000" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of skin pigmentation</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the pigmentation of the skin.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000682" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of dental enamel</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the dental enamel.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The dental enamel is the external layer of the teeth, being a highly mineralized substance consisting primarily of hydroxylapatite.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000490" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Deeply set eye</a></h3>
	An eye that is more deeply recessed into the plane of the face than is typical.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding should be distinguished from a prominent supraorbital ridge or inferior orbital margin. In Deeply set eyes, the globe is recessed in comparison to the overall prominence of the face. There is no known objective measurement, and diagnosing this feature depends heavily on the experience of the observer.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001146" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pigmentary retinal degeneration</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000580" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pigmentary retinopathy</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000546" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Retinal degeneration</a></h3>
	A deterioration of the retina. This nonspecific term is retained here because of its wide use in the literature, but if possible new annotations should indicate the precise type of retinal abnormality.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000613" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Photophobia</a></h3>
	Excessive sensitivity to light with the sensation of discomfort or pain in the eyes due to exposure to bright light.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that the term photodysphoria is used to describe extreme photophobia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100578" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Lipoatrophy</a></h3>
	Localized loss of fat tissue.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This may occur as a result of subcutanous injections of insulin in the treatment of diabetes, from the use of human growth hormone or from subcutanous injections of Copaxone used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. In the latter case, an injection may produce a small dent at the injection site. Lipoatrophy is also an adverse drug reaction that is associated with some antiretroviral drugs.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009125" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Lipodystrophy</a></h3>
	Degenerative changes of the fat tissue.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001337" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Tremor</a></h3>
	An unintentional, oscillating to-and-fro muscle movement.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Tremor is differentiated from other involuntary movement disorders, such as chorea, athetosis, ballism, tics, and myoclonus, by its repetitive, stereotyped movements of a regular amplitude and frequency. Clonus, unlike tremor, represents a rhythmic movement, which is increased by muscle stretching.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001288" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Gait disturbance</a></h3>
	The term gait disturbance can refer to any disruption of the ability to walk. In general, this can refer to neurological diseases but also fractures or other sources of pain that is triggered upon walking. However, in the current context gait disturbance refers to difficulty walking on the basis of a neurological or muscular disease.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
If possible, this term should not be used for new annotations. Rather, a more specific term should be sought.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009830" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Peripheral neuropathy</a></h3>
	Peripheral neuropathy is a general term for any disorder of the peripheral nervous system. The main clinical features used to classify peripheral neuropathy are distribution, type (mainly demyelinating versus mainly axonal), duration, and course.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006978" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dysmyelinating leukodystrophy</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002514" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebral calcification</a></h3>
	The presence of calcium deposition within brain structures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding can be demonstrated upon cerebral computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or potentially by standard radiography of the skull.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001321" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebellar hypoplasia</a></h3>
	Underdevelopment of the cerebellum.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
By prenatal ultrasound, cerebellar hypoplasia is diagnosed if the cerebellum measures more than two standard deviations below the mean. In adults, cerebellar hypoplasia is typically diagnosed by computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebellar hypoplasia can be diagnosed if there is a small cerebellum with fissures of normal size compared with the folia (this is a distinguishing characteristic compared with cerebellar atrophy).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001324" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Muscle weakness</a></h3>
	Reduced strength of muscles.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
It is important clinical to distinguish between muscle weakness, fatigue, and asthenia. Fatigue describes the inability to continue performing a task after multiple repetitions; in contrast, a patient with primary weakness is unable to perform the first repetition of the task. Asthenia is a sense of weariness or exhaustion in the absence of muscle weakness. Conditions that result in intrinsic muscle weakness can be divided into several main categories: infectious, neurologic, endocrine, inflammatory, rheumatologic, genetic, metabolic, electrolyte-induced, or drug-induced.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005750" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Contractures of the joints of the lower limbs</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100360" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Contractures of the joints of the upper limbs</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002808" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Kyphosis</a></h3>
	Exaggerated anterior convexity of the thoracic vertebral column.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002751" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Kyphoscoliosis</a></h3>
	An abnormal curvature of the spine in both a coronal (lateral) and sagittal (back-to-front) plane.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002910" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Elevated hepatic transaminases</a></h3>
	Elevations of the levels of SGOT and SGPT in the serum. SGOT (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase) and SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase) are transaminases primarily found in the liver and heart and are released into the bloodstream as the result of liver or heart damage. SGOT and SGPT are used clinically mainly as markers of liver damage.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
	Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004322" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short stature</a></h3>
	A height below that which is expected according to age and gender norms. Although there is no universally accepted definition of short stature, many refer to "short stature" as height more than 2 standard deviations below the mean for age and gender (or below the 3rd percentile for age and gender dependent norms).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
	A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000405" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Conductive hearing impairment</a></h3>
	An abnormality of vibrational conductance of sound to the inner ear leading to impairment of sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
A conductive hearing impariment with greater than 90 dB loss.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000407" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sensorineural hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A type of hearing impairment  in one or both ears related to an abnormal functionality of the cochlear nerve.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss caused by damage or dysfunction of the auditory nerve (cranial nerve VIII, also known as the cochlear nerve).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cataract</a></h3>
	A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000519" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Congenital cataract</a></h3>
	A congenital cataract.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
In general, congenital cataracts are bilateral and that is the assumption with the terms in this cataract subhierarchy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002650" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Scoliosis</a></h3>
	The presence of an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000822" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypertension</a></h3>
	The presence of chronic increased pressure in the systemic arterial system.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic BP (140 mm Hg or higher), diastolic BP (90 mm Hg or higher), or both.
