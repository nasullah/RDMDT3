<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Any combination of more than one major cranial vault suture fused at original presentation (from metopic, sagittal, left coronal, right coronal, left lambdoid, right lambdoid)<br />
- Single suture synostosis accompanied by either (a) dysmorphic features or at least one major extracranial abnormality; (b) significant learning disability; (c) first or second degree relative with craniosynostosis, or offspring of consanguineous union

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Evidence of likely secondary cause. This is most likely to comprise (a) extreme prematurity <28 weeks’ gestation; (b) complications of severe perinatal asphyxia; (c) teratogenic exposure, most commonly sodium valproate; (d) compelling history of intrauterine growth restriction; (e) documented rickets (genetic or acquired)

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
- Genome-wide copy number variation testing (e.g. aCGH, SNP array or other genomic microarray) <br />
  - DNA sequencing of FGFR3-P250R, FGFR2 exons IIIa (8) and IIIc (10), TWIST1 exon 1 in all cases<br />
  - Additional tests available for other genes as clinically indicated (nationally commissioned testing). These tests will most commonly include the EFNB1, ERF and TCF12 genes (mutations in each of these genes contribute ≥1% of craniosynostosis overall), and MLPA of TWIST1. Additional testing is currently offered for FGFR1, FGFR2 (extended screen), IL11RA, POR, RAB23 and ZIC1.

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011330" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Metopic synostosis</a></h3>
	Premature fusion of the metopic suture.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011321" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Left unilambdoid synostosis</a></h3>
	Premature synostosis of only the left lambdoid suture.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011322" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Right unilambdoid synostosis</a></h3>
	Premature synostosis of only the right lambdoid suture.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011320" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Unilambdoid synostosis</a></h3>
	Premature synostosis of only one lambdoid suture.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011324" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Multiple suture craniosynostosis</a></h3>
	Craniosynostosis involving at least 2 cranial sutures, where the exact pattern of sutures fused has not been precisely specified.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
If possible, it is preferable to annotate the precise pattern of involvement of the cranial sutures involved in craniosynostosis. This term may be chosen if more information is not available.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001363" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Craniosynostosis</a></h3>
	Craniosynostosis refers to the premature closure of the cranial sutures. Primary craniosynostosis refers to the closure of one or more sutures due to abnormalities in skull development, and secondary craniosynostosis results from failure of brain growth.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Skull deformity caused by the premature closure of the cranial sutures. Craniostenosis is a deformity of the skull caused by craniosynostosis, with consequent cessation of skull growth.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001622" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Premature birth</a></h3>
	The birth of a baby of less than 37 weeks of gestational age.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011438" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Maternal teratogenic exposure</a></h3>
	A medical history of exposure of the mother of a child or fetus to a teratogenic substance during pregnancy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Commonly encountered maternal teratogens include alcohol, antiepileptic drugs, antihypertensive and antithyroid medications, aspirin, bisphosphonates, chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, ionizing radiation, recreational drugs, and serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (a class of antidepressants).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002516" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Increased intracranial pressure</a></h3>
	An increase of the pressure inside the cranium (skull) and thereby in the brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Normal values of intracranial pressure in adults are around 7-15 mm Hg in the supine position. The term pseudotumor cerebri (also: idiopathic intracranial hypertension or benign intracranial hypertension) is the presence of increased intracranial pressure in the absence of a brain tumor or other identifiable cause. It should be coded using this term and negations of appropriate other HPO terms. Increased intracranial pressure can damage tissue, contribute to hydrocephalus, cause brain herniation, and restrict blood supply to the brain.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000202" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Oral cleft</a></h3>
	The presence of a cleft in the oral cavity, the two main types of which are cleft lip and cleft palate. In cleft lip, there is the congenital failure of the maxillary and median nasal processes to fuse, forming a groove or fissure in the lip. In cleft palate, there is a congenital failure of the palate to fuse properly, forming a grooved depression or fissure in the roof of the mouth. Clefts of the lip and palate can occur individually or together. It is preferable to code each defect separately.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000508" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ptosis</a></h3>
	The upper eyelid margin is positioned 3 mm or more lower than usual and covers the superior portion of the iris (objective); or, the upper lid margin obscures at least part of the pupil (subjective).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000486" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Strabismus</a></h3>
	Strabismus (also known as squint) is a condition in which the eyes are not properly aligned with each other.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.
