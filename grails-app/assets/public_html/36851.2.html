  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	4 consecutive months of amenorrhoea (primary or secondary), AND
•	Elevated serum FSH of &gt;30IU/L on two separate occasions at least 6 weeks apart, AND
•	Age of onset is &lt;30 years, AND
•	At least one other close family member (sister, mother, aunt or first cousin) with POF, AND
•	Availability of at least 1 additional affected family member to take part in the project

No male relatives should be recruited to this disorder. Unaffected female relatives should only be recruited if they are aged over 45 years, AND menstruation ceased after the age of 45 years.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	X chromosome abnormality such as Turner syndrome
•	Presence of FMR1 premutation
•	Iatrogenic cause (bilateral oophorectomy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or any other iatrogenic cause)
•	Presence of thyroid or adrenal auto-antibodies</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing for fragile X premutation and chromosome abnormalities is strongly recommended PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT as these may not be reliably detected by WGS using current analysis techniques.</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

Headache is one of the most common types of recurrent pain as well as one of the most frequent symptoms in neurology. In addition to occasional headaches, there are well-defined headache disorders that vary in incidence, prevalence and duration and can be divided into two broad categories. In secondary headache disorders, headaches are attributed to another condition, such as brain tumour or head injury; for the primary disorders the headache is not due to another condition.</p>
