<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002373" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Febrile seizures</a></h3>
	Febrile seizures are convulsions induced by a fever in infants or small children and are generally characterized by loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic movements. Most febrile seizures last a minute or two.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002069" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Generalized tonic-clonic seizures</a></h3>
	Generalized tonic-clonic seizures are generalized seizures with bilateral symmetrical tonic contraction then bilateral clonic contractions of somatic muscles usually associated with autonomic phenomena.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
In a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, the patient suddenly loses conciousness, the eyes roll back, and the entire body musculature undergoes tonic contractions. In the clonic phase of the seizure, there are rhythmic contractions of the musculature alternating with relaxation of all muscle groups. Loss of sphincter control during the seizure is common. This form of seizure was formerly commonly called grand mal seizure.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007193" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening</a></h3>
	Generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening are a form of Generalized tonic-clonic seizures that occur upon awaking.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007207" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Photosensitive tonic-clonic seizures</a></h3>
	Generalized tonic-clonic seizures that are triggered by flashing or flickering light.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002123" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Generalized myoclonic seizures</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001327" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Photomyoclonic seizures</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002121" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Absence seizures</a></h3>
	Recurrent absence seizures are generalized seizures and are characterized by a loss of consciousness, thus, are a form of dialeptic seizures.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011147" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Typical absence seizures</a></h3>
	Typical absences are brief for seconds generalized epileptic seizures of abrupt onset and abrupt termination with impairment of consciousness.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Typical absences have 2 essential components: (1) clinically the impairment of consciousness (absence), and (2) EEG generalized 3 Hz to 4 Hz (less than 2.5 Hz) spike and slow wave discharges.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007270" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Atypical absence seizures</a></h3>
	Absence seizures characterized by insidious begin and end and often prolonged duration, accompanied by slow spike-wave discharges on EEG.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011148" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Absence seizures with special features</a></h3>
	Absence seizures that are characterized by additional motor phenomena such as eyelid myoclonias or myoclonic seizure of the upper limbs.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term "Absence seizures with special features" is used by the International League Against Epilepsy 2010 classification.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011149" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Absence seizures with eyelid myoclonia</a></h3>
	Absence seizures that are additionally characterized by eyelid myoclonia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011150" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Myoclonic absences</a></h3>
	Absence seizures that are additionally characterized by rhythmic bilateral myoclonias of the arms and shoulders synchronous with EEG discharges, with additional tonic components of the arms.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010819" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Atonic seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures characterized by a sudden loss or diminution of muscle tone, which may be fragmentary, confined to a segment (limb, jaw, head), or massive, leading to a slumping to the ground .
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010818" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Generalized tonic seizures</a></h3>
	Generalized seizures with sustained increase in muscle contraction lasting a few seconds to minutes.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Characterized by a sudden increase in muscle tone whereby the body, arms, or legs make sudden stiffening movements and consciousness is usually preserved. Tonic seizures can occur during sleep. Tonic seizures usually affect both sides of the body, and cause a fall if the affected person was standing when the seizure started.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011169" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Generalized clonic seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures with regularly repetitive myoclonus, involving the same muscle groups, at a frequency of about 2-3 c/sec.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002353" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EEG abnormality</a></h3>
	Abnormality observed by electroencephalogram (EEG), which is used to record of the brain's spontaneous electrical activity from multiple electrodes placed on the scalp.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010850" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EEG with spike-wave complexes</a></h3>
	Complexes of spikes (<70 ms) and sharp waves (70-200 ms), which are sharp transient waves that have a strong association with epilepsy, in cerebral electrical activity recorded along the scalp by electroencephalography (EEG).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002392" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EEG with polyspike wave complexes</a></h3>
	The presence of complexes of repetitive spikes and waves in EEG.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012000" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EEG with generalized spikes</a></h3>
	EEG with generalized sharp transient waves of a duration less than 80 msec.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011198" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EEG with generalized epileptiform discharges</a></h3>
	EEG discharges recorded on the entire scalp typically seen in persons with epilepsy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Spikes (<70 ms) and sharp waves (70-200 ms) are sharp transient waves that have a strong association with epilepsy. No difference is noted in terms of clinical significance of spikes and sharp waves. Significant spikes usually are followed by a slow wave.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010858" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EEG with hyperventilation-induced epileptiform discharges</a></h3>
	Epileptiform discharges induced by hyperventilation (overbreathing) in cerebral electrical activity recorded along the scalp by electroencephalography (EEG).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hyperventilation (overbreathing) is widely used as a diagnostic procedure to activate epileptiform EEG discharges.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011184" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EEG with hyperventilation-induced generalized epileptiform discharges</a></h3>
	Generalized epileptiform discharges induced by hyperventilation (overbreathing) in cerebral electrical activity recorded along the scalp by electroencephalography (EEG).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010852" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EEG with photoparoxysmal response</a></h3>
	EEG abnormalities (epileptiform discharges) evoked by flashing lights or black and white striped patterns.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
In some patients, seizures can be provoked by specific external factors (reflex epilepsy), including flickering lights and patterns. These patients commonly show epileptiform discharges in the EEG when stimulated with flashing lights, black and white striped patterns and television. These evoked EEG abnormalities are called photoparoxysmal responses.
