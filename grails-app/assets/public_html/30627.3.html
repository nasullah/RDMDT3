- Other syndromal short stature without bone fragility<br />
- Secondary causes of bone fragility such as prolonged treatment with steroids;<br />
cerebral palsy; reduced mobility contributing to fractures

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000729" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Autistic behavior</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000938" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Osteopenia</a></h3>
	Osteopenia refers to a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) below normal peak BMD but not low enough to be classified as osteoporosis. According to the WHO, osteopenia is characterized by a value of BMD more than 1 standard deviation below the young adult mean, but less than 2 standard deviations below this value.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002691" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Platybasia</a></h3>
	A developmental malformation of the occipital bone and upper end of the cervical spine, in which the latter appears to have pushed the floor of the occipital bone upward such that there is an  abnormal flattening of the skull base.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Platybasia is malformation of the base of the skull due to softening of skull bones or a developmental anomaly, with bulging upwards of the floor of the posterior cranial fossa, upward displacement of the upper cervical vertebrae, and bony impingement on the brainstem. It results in abnormal obtuseness of the basal angle that can be demonstrated radiographically. If platybasia is associated with basilar invagination, compression of the brainstem and upper cervical cord can result.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000926" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Platyspondyly</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003179" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Protrusio acetabuli</a></h3>
	Intrapelvic bulging of the medial acetabular wall.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Protrusion of the acetabulum, which is the socket that together with the head of the femur forms the hip joint. The protrusion is the result of increased depth of the socket and results in medial displacement of the femoral head.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003304" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Spondylolysis</a></h3>
	Spondylolysis is an osseous defect of the pars interarticularis, thought to be a developmental or acquired stress fracture secondary to chronic low-grade trauma.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The pars interarticularis is one of the bony bridges that connect the upper with the lower facet joints of the vertebra. Lumbar spondylolysis is a common cause of lower back pain. The vast majority of cases of spondylolysis occur at the L5 or L4 levels, and is usually diagnosed radiographically. Over half of patients affected by spondylolysis have associated spondylolisthesis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003302" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Spondylolisthesis</a></h3>
	Complete bilateral fractures of the pars interarticularis resulting in the anterior slippage of the vertebra.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000262" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Turricephaly</a></h3>
	Tall head relative to width and length.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Turricephaly is derived from the Latin word turris, meaning tall, and refers to a round, tall (tower-like) skull. This feature may have previously been considered to overlap with or include a tall forehead. Turricephaly is present when the head appears tall (subjective) and head length and width are reduced compared to normal age-related standards (objective). Head length is measured between the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) and the most prominent part of the occiput in the midline, using spreading calipers. Head width is measured between the most lateral points of the parietal bones on each side of the head, using spreading calipers. The term acrocephaly (or oxycephaly) is used when there is turricephaly and the top of the skull assumes a cone shape.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002645" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Wormian bones</a></h3>
	The presence of extra bones within a cranial suture. Wormian bones are irregular isolated bones which appear in addition to the usual centers of ossification of the cranium.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Irregular, solated bones in the lambdoidal suture or at the fontanelles.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005855" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Multiple prenatal fractures</a></h3>
	The presence of bone fractures in the prenatal period that are diagnosed at birth or before.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003084" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Fractures of the long bones</a></h3>
	An increased tendency to fractures of the long bones (Mainly, the femur, tibia, fibula,humerus, radius, and ulna).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006640" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Multiple rib fractures</a></h3>
	More than one fracture of the ribs.
