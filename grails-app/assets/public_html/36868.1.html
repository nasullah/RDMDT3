<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Non-syndromic hearing loss in proband, AND<br />
•	Two or more additional affected family members in at least two generations, of which one must be a first degree relative of the proband and a have a similar or compatible audiometric hearing loss, AND<br />
•	Audiometry must be provided on 2 or more affected individuals.<br />
<br />
Individuals with severe or syndromic disease should be recruited according to standard guidance, typically as trios. Disease status of apparently unaffected participants should be determined according to standard clinical practice to detect cryptic disease.<br />
<br />
In other cases, unaffected individuals should not be recruited. Recruitment in such families should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs.

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Features of known syndrome

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
- All patients must have dominant monoallelic or recessive bi-allelic mutations in GJB2 excluded<br />
- UKGTN gene panel testing is available and should be encouraged

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.
