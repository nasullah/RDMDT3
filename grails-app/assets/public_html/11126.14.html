						<!-- <h2>Thoracic dystrophies eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
- Isolated thoracic dystrophy<br />
- Thoracic dystrophy with multisystem involvement: renal cysts, hepatic cysts, retinal dystrophy, laterality defect, polydactyly (>1 limb)<br />
- Thoracic dystrophy with skeletal dysplasia (e.g. pelvic dysplasia)<br />
- Thoracic dystrophy with laryngeal stenosis

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
- Established molecular diagnosis of ciliopathy<br />
- Radiology consistent with abnormal methylation pattern at chromosome 14q34

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
 - Genome-wide copy number variation testing (e.g. aCGH, SNP array or other genomic microarray)

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004322" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short stature</a></h3>
	A height below that which is expected according to age and gender norms. Although there is no universally accepted definition of short stature, many refer to "short stature" as height more than 2 standard deviations below the mean for age and gender (or below the 3rd percentile for age and gender dependent norms).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003498" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Disproportionate short stature</a></h3>
	A kind of short stature in which different regions of the body are shortened to differing extents.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003027" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Mesomelia</a></h3>
	Shortening of the middle parts of the limbs (forearm and lower leg) in relation to the upper and terminal segments.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Shortening of the limbs where the predominant shortness is in the middle bones.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010884" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Acromelia</a></h3>
	Shortening of the extremities affecting primarily the distal parts of the limbs (hands and feet) in relation to the other segments of the limbs.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003086" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Acromesomelia</a></h3>
	Small hands and feet.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001156" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Brachydactyly syndrome</a></h3>
	Digits that appear disproportionately short compared to the hand/foot. The word brachydactyly is used to describe a series of Mendelian diseases characterized by distinct patterns of shortened digits (brachydactyly types A-E). This is the sense used here, however, it is preferable to described the observed phenotypic abnormalities precisely.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001161" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hand polydactyly</a></h3>
	A kind of polydactyly characterized by the presence of a supernumerary finger or fingers.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001162" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Postaxial hand polydactyly</a></h3>
	Supernumerary digits located at the ulnar side of the hand (that is, on the side with the fifth finger).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001177" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Preaxial hand polydactyly</a></h3>
	Supernumerary digits located at the radial side of the hand. Polydactyly (supernumerary digits) involving the thumb occurs in many distinct forms of high variability and severity. Ranging from fleshy nubbins over varying degrees of partial duplication/splitting to completely duplicated or even triplicated thumbs or preaxial (on the radial side of the hand) supernumerary digits.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006159" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Mesoaxial hand polydactyly</a></h3>
	The presence of a supernumerary finger (not a thumb) involving the third or fourth metacarpal with associated osseous syndactyly.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001829" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Foot polydactyly</a></h3>
	A kind of polydactyly characterized by the presence of a supernumerary toe or toes.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001830" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Postaxial foot polydactyly</a></h3>
	Polydactyly of the foot most commonly refers to the presence of six toes on one foot. Postaxial polydactyly affects the lateral ray and the duplication may range from a well-formed articulated digit to a rudimentary digit.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The modifier postaxial means that the supernumerary digit is not a hallux.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001841" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Preaxial foot polydactyly</a></h3>
	Duplication of all or part of the first ray.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term applies for a wide variety of partial and/or complete duplications of the phalanges of the big toe (sometimes including the 1st metatarsal). A partial duplication can present itself on x-rays as a notched phalanx, bifid phalanx or a broadened phalanx. Polydactyly affecting the big toe is called preaxial or hallucal polydactyly of the feet.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001831" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short toe</a></h3>
	A toe that appears disproportionately short compared to the foot.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding must be distinguished from digits that are of increased girth but of normal length and that of a long mid- and hind foot with normal digit lengths. The affected digits should be specified as described in the introductory comments. Note that we designate brachydactyly as a synonym, but this use of the term is distinct from the use of the same word in Bell's classification of brachdactyly.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000774" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Narrow chest</a></h3>
	Reduced width of the chest from side to side, associated with a reduced distance from the sternal notch to the tip of the shoulder.

	Increased inferior to superior extent of the thorax.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002857" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Genu valgum</a></h3>
	The legs angle inward, such that the knees are close together and the ankles far apart.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003908" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Corner spurs (humeral metaphyses)</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000926" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Platyspondyly</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003375" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Narrow greater sacrosciatic notches</a></h3>
	A narrowing of the sacrosciatic notch, i.e., the deep indentation in the posterior border of the hip bone at the point of union of the ilium and ischium.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002098" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Respiratory distress</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000556" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Retinal dystrophy</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000510" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Retinitis pigmentosa</a></h3>
	Hereditary degeneration and atrophy of the retina.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Retinitis pigmentosa is a group of hereditary diseases of the eye. However, the term retinitis pigmentosa has also been used to describe the retinal findings characteristic of these diseases but also seen on other diseases such as Usher syndrome. It is preferable to describe the findings precisely if possible, but this term is kept for convenience.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001651" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dextrocardia</a></h3>
	The heart is located in the right hand sided hemithorax. That is, there is a left-right reversal (or "mirror reflection") of the anatomical location of the heart in which the heart is locate on the right side instead of the left.

	The presence of multiple cysts in both kidneys.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Most commonly, PKD arises as an inherited trait. Tremendous enlargement of both kidneys is characteristic of the autosomal dominant form of PKD, with up to hundreds or thousands of renal cysts. This term does not refer to the disease entity but rather to the finding of numerous cysts in both kidneys.
