	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000501" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Glaucoma</a></h3>
	Glaucoma refers loss of retinal ganglion cells in a characteristic pattern of optic neuropathy usually associated with increased intraocular pressure.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The feature that differentiates glaucoma from other causes of visual morbidity is a characteristic pattern of damage to the optic nerve head. This is most easily recognised at the superior and inferior poles of the optic disc. The vertical cup:disc ratio (VCDR) has proved to be a simple, relatively robust index of glaucomatous loss of the neuroretinal rim. As with intraocular pressure, VCDR is a continuous variable within the population.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012108" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Primary open angle glaucoma</a></h3>
	A type of glaucoma with optic nerve damage in an eye with evidence of significant obstruction of the functional trabecular meshwork by the peripheral iris would be classified as having primary angle closure.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Evidence of optic nerve damage can include s optic disc abnormalities (Vertical cup:disc ratio over the 97. 5th percentile in the normal population), visual field defects. The role of increased intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma is debated, but an IOP exceeding the 99. 5th percentile of the normal population may be considered to support the diagnosis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012109" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Primary angle closure glaucoma</a></h3>
	A type of glaucoma with optic nerve damage in an eye that has evidence of angle closure and in which there is no evidence of a secondary cause.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Evidence of optic nerve damage can include s optic disc abnormalities (Vertical cup:disc ratio over the 97. 5th percentile in the normal population), visual field defects. The role of increased intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma is debated, but an IOP exceeding the 99. 5th percentile of the normal population may be considered to support the diagnosis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001087" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Congenital glaucoma</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004328" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the anterior segment of the eye</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the anterior segment of the eye.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The anterior segment comprises the structures in front of the vitreous humour: the cornea, iris, ciliary body, and lens.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000627" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Posterior embryotoxon</a></h3>
	A posterior embryotoxon is the presence of a prominent and anteriorly displaced line of Schwalbe.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Schwalbe's line is the anatomical line found on the interior surface of the cornea, and delineates the outer limit of the corneal endothelium layer. Specifically, it represents the termination of Descemet's membrane. Up to 30% of the population has posterior embryotoxon as an isolated normal variant.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008511" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Central posterior corneal opacity</a></h3>
	Reduced transparency of the central posterior portion of the corneal stroma.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000482" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcornea</a></h3>
	A congenital abnormality of the cornea in which the cornea and the anterior segment of the eye are smaller than normal. The horizontal diameter of the cornea does not reach 10 mm even in adulthood.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that the cornea's diameter is normally about 9.5-10.0 mm at birth and reaches 10.0-12-5 mm in adulthood.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000485" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Megalocornea</a></h3>
	An enlargement of the cornea with normal clarity and function. Megalocornea is diagnosed with a horizontal corneal diameter of 12 mm or more at birth or 13 mm or more after two years of age.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000525" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the iris</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the iris, which is the pigmented muscular tissue between the cornea and the lens, that is perforated by an opening called the pupil.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011500" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Polycoria</a></h3>
	Multiple pupils.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009918" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ectopia pupillae</a></h3>
	A malposition of the pupil owing to a developmental defect of the iris.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007676" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypoplasia of the iris</a></h3>
	Congenital underdevelopment of the iris.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cataract</a></h3>
	A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012796" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Increased cup-to-disc ratio</a></h3>
	An elevation in the ratio of the diameter of the cup of the optic disc to the total diameter of the disc. The optic disc has an orange-pink rim with a pale centre (the cup) that does not contain neuroretinal tissue. An increase in this ratio therefoy may indicate a decrease in the quantity of healthy neuroretinal cells.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
A cup to disc ratio of 0.3 is generally considered normal. Note that the ratio is measured in the vertical orientation unless otherwise specified.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000568" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microphthalmos</a></h3>
	A developmental anomaly characterized by abnormal smallness of one or both eyes.
