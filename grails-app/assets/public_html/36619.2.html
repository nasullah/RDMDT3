	An abnormality of the gyri (i.e., the ridges) of the cerebral cortex of the brain.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002363" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of brainstem morphology</a></h3>
	An anomaly of the brainstem.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001321" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebellar hypoplasia</a></h3>
	Underdevelopment of the cerebellum.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
By prenatal ultrasound, cerebellar hypoplasia is diagnosed if the cerebellum measures more than two standard deviations below the mean. In adults, cerebellar hypoplasia is typically diagnosed by computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebellar hypoplasia can be diagnosed if there is a small cerebellum with fissures of normal size compared with the folia (this is a distinguishing characteristic compared with cerebellar atrophy).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001272" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebellar atrophy</a></h3>
	Atrophy (wasting) of the cerebellum.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Cerebellar atrophy can be diagnosed if the cerebellum is small with shrunken folia and large cerebellar fissures or if it has been shown to undergo progressive volume loss.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002119" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ventriculomegaly</a></h3>
	An increase in size of the ventricular system of the brain.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001273" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the corpus callosum</a></h3>
	Abnormality of the corpus callosum.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The corpus callosum, a broad thick band of nerve fibers that connects the right and left cerebral hemispheres, is the largest white matter structure in the brain. This finding can be demonstrated by cerebral magenetic resonance tomography. The corpus callosum structurally consists of 4 major anatomic features including the rostrum, genu, corpus, and splenium.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
	Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
	A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002376" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Developmental regression</a></h3>
	Loss of developmental skills, as manifested by loss of developmental milestones.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental regression is said to occur when a child that has reached a certain psychomotor developmental stage starts to regress and to lose the acquired milestones.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100704" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cortical visual impairment</a></h3>
	A form of loss of vision caused by damage to the visual cortex rather than a defect in the eye.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000648" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Optic atrophy</a></h3>
	Atrophy of the optic nerve. Optic atrophy results from the death of the retinal ganglion cell axons that comprise the optic nerve and manifesting as a pale optic nerve on fundoscopy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The diagnosis of optic atrophy is made when the optic disc loses its normal orange-pink color. Optic atrophy is an end stage that arises from myriad causes of optic nerve damage anywhere along the path from the retina to the lateral geniculate. Some of the most common etiologies are advanced glaucoma, optic neuritis, arteritic or non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy or a compressive lesion.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000479" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the retina</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the retina.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cataract</a></h3>
	A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000568" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microphthalmos</a></h3>

	A type of hearing impairment  in one or both ears related to an abnormal functionality of the cochlear nerve.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss caused by damage or dysfunction of the auditory nerve (cranial nerve VIII, also known as the cochlear nerve).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001626" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the cardiovascular system</a></h3>

	A myocardial disorder in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal, in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease and congenital heart disease sufficient to cause the observed myocardial abnormality.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002783" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent lower respiratory tract infections</a></h3>
	An increased susceptibility to lower respiratory tract infections as manifested by a history of recurrent lower respiratory tract infections.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002652" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Skeletal dysplasia</a></h3>
	A general term describing features characterized by abnormal development of bones and connective tissues.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The word skeletal dysplasia is most often used to describe a group of over 380 inherited conditions that involve abnormal development of bones and connective tissues. However, the word can also be used to describe the presence of a congenital defects of bones or connective tissues that are found in one or more of the diseases, especially on prenatal ultrasound, i.e., a situation in which it is often not yet possible to make an exact etiological diagnosis. This is the sense of the phrase we use in the HPO. It is, however, preferable to annotate the observed abnormalities.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009710" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Chilblain lesions</a></h3>
	Chilblains are acral ulcers.

	Ab abnormality of the endocrine system.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The endocrine system is composed of glands that secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream and includes the following glands: thyroid, parathyroids, adrenals, pancreas, gonads (testicles and ovaries), and pituitary. Many other organs, such as the kidney, liver, and heart, have secondary endocrine functions.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001264" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Spastic diplegia</a></h3>
	Spasticity (neuromuscular hypertonia) primarily in the muscles of the legs, hips, and pelvis.

	Paralysis of all four limbs, and trunk of the body below the level of an associated injury to the spinal cord. The etiology of quadriplegia is similar to that of paraplegia except that the lesion is in the cervical spinal cord rather than in the thoracic or lumbar segments of the spinal cord.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009830" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Peripheral neuropathy</a></h3>
	Peripheral neuropathy is a general term for any disorder of the peripheral nervous system. The main clinical features used to classify peripheral neuropathy are distribution, type (mainly demyelinating versus mainly axonal), duration, and course.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001283" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Bulbar palsy</a></h3>
	Bulbar weakness (or bulbar palsy) refers to bilateral impairment of function of the lower cranial nerves IX, X, XI and XII, which occurs due to lower motor neuron lesion either at nuclear or fascicular level in the medulla or from bilateral lesions of the lower cranial nerves outside the brain-stem. Bulbar weakness is often associated with difficulty in chewing, weakness of the facial muscles, dysarthria, palatal weakness and regurgitation of fluids, dysphagia, and dysphonia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001300" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Parkinsonism</a></h3>
	Characteristic neurologic anomaly resulting form degeneration of dopamine-generating cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain, characterized clinically by shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement and difficulty with walking and gait.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001332" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dystonia</a></h3>
	An abnormally increased muscular tone that causes fixed abnormal postures. There is a slow, intermittent twisting motion that leads to exaggerated turning and posture of the extremities and trunk.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002072" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Chorea</a></h3>
	Chorea (Greek for 'dance') refers to widespread arrhythmic involuntary movements of a forcible, jerky and restless fashion.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.
