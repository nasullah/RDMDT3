  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Ectodermal dysplasia i.e. abnormality of at least two of the following: - nails - teeth - hair - sweating -  With or without additional phenotypic features e.g. clefting, limb defects, hearing loss.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Mutation in known ectodermal dysplasia gene</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 -	According to phenotype: EDA, EDAR, EDARADD, WNT10A and/or TP63</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000968" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ectodermal dysplasia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Ectodermal dysplasia is a group of conditions in which there is abnormal development of the skin, hair, nails, teeth, or sweat glands.

Comment:
This term is kept in the HPO for now as &#39;ectodermal dysplasia&#39; has been recorded as a phenotypic of other disorders such as DEAFNESS WITH ANHIDROTIC ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA (MIM125050). Nevertheless it is preferable to use precise descriptions of the phenotypic abnormalities and this term should not be used for new annotations. It will be made obsolete in the future.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A condition in which middle parts of the hands and/or feet (digits and meta-carpals and -tarsals) are missing giving a cleft appearance. The severity is very variable ranging from slightly hypoplastic 3rd toe/fingers over absent 2nd or 3rd toes/fingers as far as oligo- or monodactyl hands and/or feet.

Comment:
Hands and feet in one individual might be similarly affected or very diverse and the phenotype is very variable even within families. Penetrance is reduced and some idnividuals have been observed presenting only with unilateral smaller 2nd toe which may be overlooked till a much more severly affected family member is seen.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012385" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Camptodactyly</a></h3>

Bony fusions are revered to as &quot;bony&quot; syndactyly if the fusion occurs in a radio-ulnar axis. Fusions of bones of the fingers or toes in a proximo-distal axis are refered to as &quot;symphalangism&quot;.

Comment:
Syndactyly may be partial or complete. In complete syndactyly, the skin is joined all the way to the fingertip. In partial (incomplete) syndactyly, the skin is only joined part of the distance to the fingertip.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Partial fusion of the upper and lower eyelid margins by single or multiple bands of tissue.

Comment:
A minimally expressed form, especially when located fully laterally, may be more difficult to ascertain and would be a subjective feature. A band may break and leave no evidence of its presence. Note that the term is distinct from cryptophthalmos.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000564" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Lacrimal duct atresia</a></h3>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Cleft palate is a developmental defect of the palate resulting from a failure of fusion of the palatine processes and manifesting as a separation of the roof of the mouth (soft and hard palate).

Comment:
Cleft palate is a developmental defect that occurs between the 7th and 12th week of pregnancy. Normally, the palatine processes fuse during this time to form the soft and hard palate. A failure of fusion results in a cleft palate. The clinical spectrum ranges from bifid uvula, to (incomplete or complete) cleft of the soft palate, up to (complete or incomplete) cleft of both the soft and hard palate.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.

Comment:
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term &#39;psychomotor retardation&#39; is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.

Comment:
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.

Comment:
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.</p>
