<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- At least three out of the five of the following:<br />
  - Vertebral anomalies<br />
  - Oesophageal atresia and tracheo-oesophageal fistula<br />
  - Cardiac malformation<br />
  - Renal malformation<br />
  - Limb defect

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
- severe developmental delay - epibulbar dermoid - pre-auricular tags - bilateral limb defect

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
-	Genome-wide copy number variation testing (e.g. aCGH, SNP array or other genomic microarray)<br />
-	EFTUD2 (if suggestive clinical findings, e.g. microcephaly, facial asymmetry, inner ear anomalies)<br />
-	chromosome breakage/Fanconi studies (if suggestive clinical findings, e.g. IUGR, growth retardation, microcephaly, hypo/hyperpigmentation)

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.
