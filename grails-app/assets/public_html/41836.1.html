  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">One of more episodes of HLH (at least 5/8 criteria as defined by the Histiocyte Society), AND
An first, second or third degree relative with HLH or a related disorder (including dysgammaglobulinaemia, aplastic anaemia, lymphoma) 
AND at least one of the following:  
- Recurrent HLH (&gt;4 weeks after initiating treatment for first episode)  
- Persistent HLH (no full remission can be achieved)  
- Partial albinism
- At least one assay with absent degranulation (NK or CTL) or two assays with reduced degranulation

Standard nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed: Perforin expression by flow cytometry; (males) SAP and XIAP protein expression by flow cytometry; degranulation assay (NK and T cells); blood film for neutrophil granules; hair microscopy</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Age &gt;20 (unless familial)
Known and secure diagnosis of systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis or connective tissue disease, implying secondary HLH (macrophage activation syndrome)</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice: 
 Relevant genetic testing should be carried out as guided by the results of functional tests, this may include the targeted resequencing of the following: PRF1, SH2D1A, XIAP, STX11, STXBP2, UNC13D, LYST, RAB27A, AP3B1</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003281" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Increased serum ferritin</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormal raised concentration of ferritin, a ubiquitous intracellular protein that stores iron, in the blood.

Comment:
Ferritin levels measured in serum usually have a direct correlation with the total amount of iron stored in the body, but ferritin levels may also be increased with anemia of chronic disease or in the course of an acute phase reaction.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001903" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anemia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A reduction in erythrocytes volume or hemoglobin concentration.

Comment:
Anemia is not a specific entity but can result from many underlying pathologic processes. The three main causes of anemia are blood loss, decreased or faulty red blood cell production, and increased destruction of red blood cells. Various classifications are in clinical use including a classification according to the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the erythrocytes: microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic. Anemias can also be classified according to variations in cell size and shape, as reflected by the red-cell distribution width (RDW). Additionally, anemias can be classified into those of inadequate production and hemolytic anemias.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001873" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Thrombocytopenia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A reduction in the number of circulating thrombocytes.

Comment:
Thrombocytopenia can be divided into three major causes; 1) low production of platelets in the bone marrow; 2) intravascular breakdown of thrombocytes; and 3) increased turnover of platelets in spleen or liver (extravascular).</p>
