cystinosis, drugs etc)<br />
- Proteinuria or FSGS secondary to other identified primary renal disorder (e.g.<br />

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
-  No gene accounts for >10% of cases. Consideration of sequencing with (UKGTN approved) SRNS gene panel of 33 genes, which detected a mutation in ~20% of cases. Genes included are: ACTN4, ALG1, ALMS1, APOL1, ARHGAP24, ARHGDIA, CD151,CD2AP, COL4A3, COL4A4, COL4A5, COQ2, COQ6, CYP11B2, E2F3, INF2,<br />

Comment:<br />
Note that this term can include or combine variations in size and shape, with partial or complete absence of structures. It is preferable to describe the individual components, which are defined below. It is nonetheless a widely used bundled term and as such is retained here. The distinction of this finding from a marked degree of Hypospadias is an example of how this term can be problematic. Genetic gender is determined at fertilization, whereby the presence of a Y chromosome determines male gender. Normally, genetic gender determines gonadal gender which in turn determines phenotypic gender. Testicular development is an active process requiring expression of the primary testis determining gene SRY, which is located on the Y chromosome.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000458" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anosmia</a></h3>
	An inability to perceive odors. This is a general term describing inability to smell arising in any part of the process of smelling from absorption of odorants into the nasal mucous overlying the olfactory epithelium, diffusion to the cilia, binding to olfactory receptor sites, generation of action potentials in olfactory neurons, and perception of a smell.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009794" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Branchial anomaly</a></h3>
	Congenital developmental defect arising from the primitive branchial apparatus.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
During embryonic development the major head and neck structures are formed from the five pharyngeal arches (bands of tissue). Incomplete, failed or persistent embryonic development of these arches results in several anomalies or defects in the neck.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000028" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cryptorchidism</a></h3>
	Testis in inguinal canal. That is, absence of one or both testes from the scrotum owing to failure of the testis or testes to descend through the inguinal canal to the testis.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The gonad is mobile and can be retracted superiorly by the cremaster muscle reflex stimulated, for instance, by cold or touch. A retracted testis is not cryptorchidism. An abdominal testis cannot be distinguished by physical examination from an (Apparently) absent testis and requires radiological (or, rarely, surgical) procedures for assessment.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000819" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Diabetes mellitus</a></h3>
	A group of abnormalities characterized by hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000356" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the outer ear</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the external ear.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001999" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal facial shape</a></h3>
	An abnormal morphology (form) of the face or its components.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term now covers many of the historical inexact descriptions such as Bird-like facies that probably should be avoided in modern genetics. This portion of the Ontology should be revised.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
	A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000135" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypogonadism</a></h3>
	A decreased functionality of the gonad.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Reduced functioning of the gonads (ovaries or testes) with reduced production of sex hormones.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000478" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the eye</a></h3>
	Any abnormality of the eye, including location, spacing, and intraocular abnormalities.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001696" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Situs inversus totalis</a></h3>
	A left-right reversal (or "mirror reflection") of the anatomical location of the major thoracic and abdominal organs.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012577" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Thin glomerular basement membrane</a></h3>
	Reduction in thickness of the basal lamina of the glomerulus of the kidney.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding is demonstrated on renal biopsy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004722" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Thickening of the glomerular basement membrane</a></h3>
	Increase in thickness of the basal lamina of the glomerulus of the kidney.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding is demonstrated on renal biopsy.
