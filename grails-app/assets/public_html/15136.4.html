	The presence of excess amniotic fluid in the uterus during pregnancy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Polyhydramnios is diagnosed if the deepest vertical pool of amniotic fluid is more than 8 cm or amniotic fluid index is more than 95th percentile for the corresponding gestational age.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002804" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita</a></h3>
	A non-progressive finding characterized by multiple joint contractures found throughout the body at birth.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is related to fetal akinesia owing to fetal neurogenic, muscle, or connective tissue disorders or occasionally to maternal conditions. AMC can be associated with polyhydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, micrognathia, ocular hypertelorism, and short umbilical cord. AMC is a feature of a heterogeneous group of disorders, some of which have the phrase 'arthrogryposis multiplex congenita' as a part of their name (for instance, Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, distal type 1 or AMCD1). This term refers to the finding of multiple joint contractures found throughout the body at birth rather than to the disease entities of which this is a clinical feature.

	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.

<br />
Comment:<br />
Distal lower limb muscle atrophy is commonly due to peripheral neuropathy.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001324" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Muscle weakness</a></h3>
	Reduced strength of muscles.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
It is important clinical to distinguish between muscle weakness, fatigue, and asthenia. Fatigue describes the inability to continue performing a task after multiple repetitions; in contrast, a patient with primary weakness is unable to perform the first repetition of the task. Asthenia is a sense of weariness or exhaustion in the absence of muscle weakness. Conditions that result in intrinsic muscle weakness can be divided into several main categories: infectious, neurologic, endocrine, inflammatory, rheumatologic, genetic, metabolic, electrolyte-induced, or drug-induced.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008997" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Proximal muscle weakness in upper limbs</a></h3>
	A lack of strength of the proximal muscles of the arms.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008994" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Proximal muscle weakness in lower limbs</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009053" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Distal lower limb muscle weakness</a></h3>
	Reduced strength of the distal musculature of the legs.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding can be due to peripheral neuropathy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003473" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Fatigable weakness</a></h3>
	A type of weakness that occurs after a muscle group is used and lessens if the muscle group has some rest. That is, there is diminution of strength with repetitive muscle actions.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This type of weakness is pathognomonic for an abnormality of the neuromuscular junction such as myasthenia gravis. A characteristic form of muscular weakness that worsens after use of affected muscles. Myasthenia is caused by  failure of neuromuscular transmission, which results from the binding of autoantibodies to proteins involved in signaling at the neuromuscular junction, including especially the nicotinic acetyl choline receptor (AChR) or, less frequently, a muscle-specific tyrosine kinase involved in AChR clustering.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009020" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Exercise-induced muscle fatigue</a></h3>
	An abnormally increased tendency towards muscle fatigue induced by physical exercise.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003388" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Easy fatigability</a></h3>
	Increased susceptibility to fatigue.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Fatigue describes the inability to continue performing a task after multiple repetitions.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003474" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sensory impairment</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the primary sensation that is mediated by peripheral nerves (pain, temperature, touch, vibration, joint position). The word hypoesthesia (or hyesthesia) refers to a reduction in cutaneous sensation to a specific type of testing.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term does not include abnormalities of cortical sensation such as two-point discrimination, stereognosis, and graphesthesia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002880" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Respiratory difficulties</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002878" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Respiratory failure</a></h3>
	A severe form of respiratory insufficiency characterized by inadequate gas exchange such that the levels of oxygen or carbon dioxide cannot be maintained within normal limits.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Respiratory failure is classified as type 1 with hypoxemia (arterial partial pressure of oxygen less than 60 mmHg) without hypercapnea, and type 2 with hypoxemia in the present of hypercapnea (partial pressure of carbon dioxide over 50 mmHg).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010307" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Stridor</a></h3>
	Stridor is a high pitched sound resulting from turbulent air flow in the upper airway.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002872" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Apneic episodes precipitated by illness, fatigue, stress</a></h3>
	Recurrent episodes of apnea that are precipitated by factors such as illness, fatigue, or stress.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002093" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Respiratory insufficiency</a></h3>
	Failure to adequately provide oxygen to cells of the body and to remove excess carbon dioxide.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004887" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Respiratory failure requiring assisted ventilation</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011025" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of cardiovascular system physiology</a></h3>
	Abnormal functionality of the cardiovascular system.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011675" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Arrhythmia</a></h3>
	Any cardiac rhythm other than the normal sinus rhythm. Such a rhythm may be either of sinus or ectopic origin and either regular or irregular. An arrhythmia may be due to a disturbance in impulse formation or conduction or both.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001638" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cardiomyopathy</a></h3>
	A myocardial disorder in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal, in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease and congenital heart disease sufficient to cause the observed myocardial abnormality.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003457" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG abnormality</a></h3>
	Abnormal results of investigations using electromyography (EMG).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003458" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: myopathic abnormalities</a></h3>
	The presence of abnormal electromyographic patterns indicative of myopathy, such as small-short polyphasic motor unit potentials.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003445" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: neuropathic changes</a></h3>
	The presence of characteristic findings of denervation on electromyography (fibrillations, positive sharp waves, and giant motor unit potentials).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This is a bundled term. It is preferable to annotate the precise clinical observations, but the term is kept now for convenience.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100283" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: continuous motor unit activity at rest</a></h3>
	Continuous electromyographic activity of motor units at rest, i.e., without voluntary movement of the muscles.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The motor unit contains an anterior horn cell, its axon, and all of the muscle fibers that it innervates via the neuromuscular junction. Note that a healthy relaxed muscle does not show significant EMG activity at rest.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010546" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Muscle fibrillation</a></h3>
	Fine, rapid twitching of individual muscle fibers with little or no movement of the muscle as a whole. If a motor neuron or its axon is destroyed, the muscle fibers it innervates undergo denervation atrophy. This leads to hypersensitivity of individual muscle fibers to acetyl choline so that they may contract spontaneously. Isolated activity of individual muscle fibers is generally so fine it cannot be seen through the intact skin, although it can be recorded as a short-duration spike in the EMG.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003730" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: myotonic runs</a></h3>
	Spontaneous, repetitive electrical activity demonstrated by electromyography (EMG).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This is a characteristic abnormality seen in the myotonias and periodic paralyses.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007002" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Motor axonal neuropathy</a></h3>
	Progressive impairment of function of motor axons with muscle weakness, atrophy, and cramps. The deficits are length-dependent, meaning that muscles innervated by the longest nerves are affected first, so that for instance the arms are affected at a later age than the onset of deficits involving the lower leg.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Distal motor neuropathy is a bundled term that should not be used if more detailed information about the phenotype is available.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007220" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Demyelinating motor neuropathy</a></h3>
	Demyelination of peripheral motor nerves.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Demyelinating motor neuropathy demonstrates slow motor nerve conduction velocities with reduced amplitudes of motor nerve conduction and prolonged distal latencies.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003448" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Decreased sensory nerve conduction velocity</a></h3>
	Reduced speed of conduction of the action potential along a sensory nerve.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) in response to electrical stimulation is recorded from the nerve itself by means of dermal recording electrodes. The SNAP is the sum of all the action potentials generated in sensory nerve fibres by the applied electrical impulse.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003390" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sensory axonal neuropathy</a></h3>
	An axonal neuropathy of peripheral sensory nerves.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011402" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Demyelinating sensory neuropathy</a></h3>
	Demyelination of peripheral sensory nerves.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100285" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: impaired neuromuscular transmission</a></h3>
	An electromyographic finding associated with erratic or absent neuromuscular transmission with erratic, moment-to-moment changes in the shape of the motor unit potential (MUP).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003403" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: decremental response of compound muscle action potential to repetitive nerve stimulation</a></h3>
	A compound muscle action potential (CMAP) is a type of electromyography (EMG). CMAP refers to a group of almost simultaneous action potentials from several muscle fibers in the same area evoked by stimulation of the supplying motor nerve and are recorded as one multipeaked summated action potential. This abnormality refers to a greater than normal decrease in the amplitude during the course of the investigation.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The result of this test is abnormal if progressively fewer muscle fibers respond to nerve stimulation during a train of stimuli, thereby yielding a decrementing pattern in the CMAP.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011805" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of muscle morphology</a></h3>
	A structural abnormality of a skeletal muscle.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009830" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Peripheral neuropathy</a></h3>
	Peripheral neuropathy is a general term for any disorder of the peripheral nervous system. The main clinical features used to classify peripheral neuropathy are distribution, type (mainly demyelinating versus mainly axonal), duration, and course.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003198" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Myopathy</a></h3>
	A disorder of muscle unrelated to impairment of innervation or neuromuscular junction.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The diagnosis of myopathy is often confirmed on the basis of myopathic changes in muscle biopsy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003560" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Muscular dystrophy</a></h3>
	The term dystrophy means abnormal growth. However, muscular dystrophy is used to describe primary myopathies with a genetic basis and a progressive course characterized by progressive skeletal muscle weakness and wasting, defects in muscle proteins, and histological features of muscle fiber degeneration (necrosis) and regeneration. If possible, it is preferred to use other HPO terms to describe the precise phenotypic abnormalities.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Muscular dystrophy can be demonstrated by muscle biopsy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012785" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Flexion contracture of finger</a></h3>
	Chronic loss of joint motion in a finger due to structural changes in non-bony tissue.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that the term camptodactyly refers to a painless flexion contracture of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint and not to a finger joint contracture in general.
