<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
Lipid levels either pre-treatment or highest on treatment: <br />
•	Simon Broome criteria ‘definite familial hypercholesterolaemia’:<br />
    •	Abnormal lipids:<br />
	-Total cholesterol > 6.7 mmol/l (260 mg/dl), or LDL cholesterol above 4.0 mmol/l  in a child < 16 years, OR<br />
	-Total cholesterol >7.5 mmol/l (290 mg/dl), or LDL cholesterol above 4.9 mmol/l (190 mg/dl) in an adult<br />
    AND<br />
    -Tendon xanthomas (TX) in patient, or in 1st degree relative (parent, sibling, child), or in 2nd degree relative (grandparent, uncle, aunt) <br />
OR<br />
    •	Abnormal lipids:<br />
	-Total cholesterol > 6.7 mmol/l (260 mg/dl), or LDL cholesterol above 4.0 mmol/l  in a child < 16 years, OR<br />
	-Total cholesterol >8.5 mmol/l, or LDL cholesterol above 5.5 mmol/l in an adult<br />
    AND<br />
    - Family history of myocardial infarction below age of 50 in 2nd degree relative or below   age 60 in 1st degree relative, OR<br />
    - Family history of raised cholesterol: >7.5 mmol/l in adult 1st or 2nd degree relative or > 6.7 mmol/l in child or sibling under 16<br />
AND<br />
    •	Polygenic risk 12-SNP gene score in the bottom two quartiles

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Secondary causes of elevated LDL-C. Patients will only be eligible who have elevated LDL-C on measures taken on a fasting blood sample and after secondary causes of hyperlipidaemia have been excluded.<br />
•	Recessive inheritance. Families showing a recessive pattern of inheritance will not be recruited<br />
•	Individuals with a fasting plasma Triglyceride level of over 2.5mmol/l will be excluded.

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
LDLR, APOB and PCSK9<br />
Polygenic risk 12-SNP gene score

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003077" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperlipidemia</a></h3>
	An elevated lipid concentration in the blood.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hyperlipidemia is an elevation of the blood levels of lipids including primarily cholesterol, phospholipids and triglycerides and cholesterol esters. The lipids are transported on lipoproteins some of which are commonly used for clinical measurements, including chylomicrons, very-low density lipoproteins (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), low-density lipoproteins, and high-density lipoproteins (HDL).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003124" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypercholesterolemia</a></h3>
	An increased concentration of cholesterol in the blood.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0045014" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypolipidemia</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003141" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperbetalipoproteinemia</a></h3>
	An elevated concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the blood.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001297" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Stroke</a></h3>
	Sudden impairment of blood flow to a part of the brain due to occlusion or rupture of an artery to the brain.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001658" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Myocardial infarction</a></h3>
	Necrosis of the myocardium caused by an obstruction of the blood supply to the heart and often associated with chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, and anxiety as well as characteristic EKG findings and elevation of serum markers including creatine kinase-MB fraction and troponin.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002155" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypertriglyceridemia</a></h3>
	An abnormal increase in the level of triglycerides in the blood.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010980" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperlipoproteinemia</a></h3>
	An abnormal increase in the level of lipoprotein cholesterol in the blood.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002797" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Osteolysis</a></h3>
	Osteolysis refers to the destruction of bone through bone resorption with removal or loss of calcium.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Osteolysis may be a feature of neoplastic, infectious, metabolis, vascular, and joint disorders and is also a component of many hereditary diseases. Osteolysis may be highly localized or more diffuse. This term is meant to group the more specific osteolysis terms.
