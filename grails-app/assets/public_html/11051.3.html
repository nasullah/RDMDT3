<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
	A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000407" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sensorineural hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A type of hearing impairment  in one or both ears related to an abnormal functionality of the cochlear nerve.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss caused by damage or dysfunction of the auditory nerve (cranial nerve VIII, also known as the cochlear nerve).

	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000505" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Visual impairment</a></h3>
	Visual impairment (or vision impairment) is vision loss (of a person) to such a degree as to qualify as an additional support need through a significant limitation of visual capability resulting from either disease, trauma, or congenital or degenerative conditions that cannot be corrected by conventional means, such as refractive correction, medication, or surgery.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002133" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Status epilepticus</a></h3>
	Seizures lasting for more than 30 minutes or longer or multiple seizures repeated frequently without regaining consciousness between seizures.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
	Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002373" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Febrile seizures</a></h3>
	Febrile seizures are convulsions induced by a fever in infants or small children and are generally characterized by loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic movements. Most febrile seizures last a minute or two.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007359" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Focal seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures of which initial semiology indicates, or is consistent with, initial activation of only part of one cerebral hemisphere.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Partial seizures can be classified as simple (consciousness is maintained) or complex (consciousness is impaired or lost).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002121" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Absence seizures</a></h3>
	Recurrent absence seizures are generalized seizures and are characterized by a loss of consciousness, thus, are a form of dialeptic seizures.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010628" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Facial palsy</a></h3>
	Facial nerve palsy is a dysfunction of cranial nerve VII (the facial nerve) that results in inability to control facial muscles on the affected side with weakness of the muscles of facial expression and eye closure. This can either be present in unilateral or bilateral form.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Several conditions can cause a facial paralysis, e.g. brain tumor, stroke, and Lyme disease. However, if no specific cause can be identified, the condition is known as Bell's palsy. Named after Scottish anatomist Charles Bell, who first described it. Bell's palsy is the most common acute mononeuropathy (disease involving only one nerve) and is the most common cause of acute facial nerve paralysis.

	Reduced strength of the axial musculature (i.e., of the muscles of the head and neck, spine, and ribs).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003701" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Proximal muscle weakness</a></h3>
	A lack of strength of the proximal muscles.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001315" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Reduced tendon reflexes</a></h3>
	Diminution of tendon reflexes, which is an invariable sign of peripheral nerve disease.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The deep tendon reflex is a monosynaptic reflex arc with sensory and motor nerve components, but the arc is much more vulnerable to sensory nerve damage. Ankle plantar flexion is retained in all but the most severe peripheral neuropathies, and thus loss of the Achilles tendon reflex in an objective indication of a substantial sensory nerve defect.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001284" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Areflexia</a></h3>
	Absence of neurologic reflexes such as the knee-jerk reaction.<br />

	A reduction in the speed at which electrical signals propagate along the axon of a neuron.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Nerve conduction velocity is usually measured with surface electrodes placed on the skin over nerves at various locations. Following stimulation at one electrode, the speed at which the signal is propagated to other electrodes is recorded. Abnormal values may suggest demyelination, a conduction block, or axonopathy.

	A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000648" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Optic atrophy</a></h3>
	Atrophy of the optic nerve. Optic atrophy results from the death of the retinal ganglion cell axons that comprise the optic nerve and manifesting as a pale optic nerve on fundoscopy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The diagnosis of optic atrophy is made when the optic disc loses its normal orange-pink color. Optic atrophy is an end stage that arises from myriad causes of optic nerve damage anywhere along the path from the retina to the lateral geniculate. Some of the most common etiologies are advanced glaucoma, optic neuritis, arteritic or non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy or a compressive lesion.

	An abnormality of the liver.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001947" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Renal tubular acidosis</a></h3>
	Acidosis owing to malfunction of the kidney tubules with accumulation of metabolic acids and hyperchloremia, potentially leading to complications including hypokalemia, hypercalcinuria, nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002910" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Elevated hepatic transaminases</a></h3>
	Elevations of the levels of SGOT and SGPT in the serum. SGOT (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase) and SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase) are transaminases primarily found in the liver and heart and are released into the bloodstream as the result of liver or heart damage. SGOT and SGPT are used clinically mainly as markers of liver damage.

	Failure to thrive (FTT) refers to a child whose physical growth is substantially below the norm.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Although there is no clear consensus on the exact definition of FTT, it is usually diagnoses in a child growing below the 3rd percentile or in a child whose decreased growth has cross two major growth percentiles (for example, from above the 75th percentile to below the 25th percentile).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000126" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hydronephrosis</a></h3>
	Severe distention of the kidney with dilation of the renal pelvis and calices.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hydronephrosis can be caused by reflux or by retrograde pressure on the kidney when the flow of urine is obstructed.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008064" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ichthyosis</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the skin characterized the presence of excessive amounts of dry surface scales on the skin resulting from an abnormality of keratinization.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The ichthyoses are a group of skin diseases characterized by drying and scaling of skin with the accumulation of thick scales and cracks that may be painful or bleed. The abnormality in ichthyosis lies in am imbalance in the normal lifecycle of skin in which growth is matched with dying and shedding of skin cells. In ichthyosis, skin cells reproduce at a rate faster than dead skin cells can be shed or reproduce at a normal rate with a reduction in the rate of shedding. Either abnormality leads to a build up of dry and scaly skin. Note that this term refers to the morphological abnormality of the skin and not the disorder.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003111" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of ion homeostasis</a></h3>
	Abnormality of the homeostasis (concentration) of a monoatomic ion.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001903" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anemia</a></h3>
	A reduction in erythrocytes volume or hemoglobin concentration.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Anemia is not a specific entity but can result from many underlying pathologic processes. The three main causes of anemia are blood loss, decreased or faulty red blood cell production, and increased destruction of red blood cells. Various classifications are in clinical use including a classification according to the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the erythrocytes: microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic. Anemias can also be classified according to variations in cell size and shape, as reflected by the red-cell distribution width (RDW). Additionally, anemias can be classified into those of inadequate production and hemolytic anemias.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012269" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal muscle glycogen content</a></h3>
	Any anomaly in the amount of glycogen in muscle tissue.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Glycogen functions as a secondary short term energy storage in muscle.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030230" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Central core regions in muscle fibers</a></h3>
	The presence of disorganized areas called cores in the center of muscle fibers. There is a typical appearance of the biopsy on light microscopy, where the muscle cells have cores that are devoid of mitochondria and specific enzymes. Cores are typically well demarcated and centrally located, but may occasionally be multiple and of eccentric.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003557" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Increased variability in muscle fiber diameter</a></h3>
	An abnormally high degree of muscle fiber size variation. This phenotypic feature can be observed upon muscle biopsy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding can be demonstrated by muscle biopsy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003803" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Type 1 muscle fiber predominance</a></h3>
	An abnormal predominance of type I muscle fibers (in general, this feature can only be observed on muscle biopsy).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding is demonstrated by muscle biopsy.
