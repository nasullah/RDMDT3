<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Genome-wide copy number variant analysis abnormal and clearly pathogenic

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
- Genome-wide copy number variant analysis (e.g. aCGH, SNP array or other genomic microarray)

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	Any abnormality of the cornea, which is the transparent tissue at the front of the eye that covers the iris, pupil, and anterior chamber.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001159" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Syndactyly</a></h3>
	Webbing or fusion of the fingers or toes, involving soft parts only or including bone structure. Bony fusions are revered to as "bony" syndactyly if the fusion occurs in a radio-ulnar axis. Fusions of bones of the fingers or toes in a proximo-distal axis are refered to as "symphalangism".<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Syndactyly may be partial or complete. In complete syndactyly, the skin is joined all the way to the fingertip. In partial (incomplete) syndactyly, the skin is only joined part of the distance to the fingertip.

	An abnormality of vibrational conductance of sound to the inner ear leading to impairment of sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
A conductive hearing impariment with greater than 90 dB loss.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001631" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Defect in the atrial septum</a></h3>
	Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a congenital abnormality of the interatrial septum that enables blood flow between the left and right atria via the interatrial septum.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001762" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Talipes equinovarus</a></h3>
	Talipes equinovarus (also called clubfoot) typically has four main components: inversion and adduction of the forefoot; inversion of the heel and hindfoot; equinus (limitation of extension) of the ankle and subtalar joint; and internal rotation of the leg.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Clubfoot is a complex, multifactorial deformity with genetic and intrauterine factors. One popular theory postulates that a clubfoot is a result of intrauterine maldevelopment of the talus that leads to adduction and plantarflexion of the foot. On radiographic projection a clubfoot can be noted as parallel axes of talus and calcaneus.

	The presence of an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000062" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ambiguous genitalia</a></h3>
	A genital phenotype that is not clearly assignable to a single gender. Ambiguous genitalia can be evaluated using the Prader scale: Prader 0: Normal female external genitalia. Prader 1: Female external genitalia with clitoromegaly. Prader 2: Clitoromegaly with partial labial fusion forming a funnel-shaped urogenital sinus. Prader 3: Increased phallic enlargement. Complete labioscrotal fusion forming a urogenital sinus with a single opening. Prader 4: Complete scrotal fusion with urogenital opening at the base or on the shaft of the phallus. Prader 5: Normal male external genitalia. The diagnosis of ambiguous genitalia is made for Prader 1-4.<br />

Note that this term can include or combine variations in size and shape, with partial or complete absence of structures. It is preferable to describe the individual components, which are defined below. It is nonetheless a widely used bundled term and as such is retained here. The distinction of this finding from a marked degree of Hypospadias is an example of how this term can be problematic. Genetic gender is determined at fertilization, whereby the presence of a Y chromosome determines male gender. Normally, genetic gender determines gonadal gender which in turn determines phenotypic gender. Testicular development is an active process requiring expression of the primary testis determining gene SRY, which is located on the Y chromosome.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
	A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001251" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ataxia</a></h3>
	Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- oder overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Ataxia can be differentiated into dyssynergy, asynergy, dysmetria (hypometria, hypermetria), dysdiadochokinesis, gait ataxia, truncal ataxia, limb ataxia, and dysarthria). Note: This term does not include sensory ataxia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001332" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dystonia</a></h3>
	An abnormally increased muscular tone that causes fixed abnormal postures. There is a slow, intermittent twisting motion that leads to exaggerated turning and posture of the extremities and trunk.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002011" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Morphological abnormality of the central nervous system</a></h3>
	A structural abnormality of the central nervous system.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010880" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Increased nuchal translucency</a></h3>
	The presence of an abnormally large hypoechoic space in the posterior fetal neck (usually detected on prenatal ultrasound examination).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Increased nuchal translucency may be related to a cystic hygroma or to mesenchymal edema. Increased nuchal translucency can be classified into three categories: 1) cardiac abnormalities, combined with abnormal ductus venosus flow velocities, is found, leading to the theory that cardiac failure causes nuchal translucency enlargement; 2) various types of abnormalities are found in the extracellular matrix of the nuchal skin of fetuses with increased nuchal translucency; 3) abnormal lymphatic development is demonstrated in fetuses with increased nuchal translucency.
