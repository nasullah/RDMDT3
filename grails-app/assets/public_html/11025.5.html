						<!-- <h2>Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy Eligibility</h2> -->
Relevant diseases:<br />
<br />
- Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)<br />
- Dilated cardiomyopathy<br />
- Dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction defects

<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
- Patients with a clear diagnosis and at least one affected relative

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Unclear diagnosis or history suggestive of a non-genetic cause

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
- ARVC - PKP2, DSP, DSG2, DSC2

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

						<!-- <h2>Cardiomyopathy Phenotypes</h2> -->

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000822" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypertension</a></h3>
	The presence of chronic increased pressure in the systemic arterial system.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic BP (140 mm Hg or higher), diastolic BP (90 mm Hg or higher), or both.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001635" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Congestive heart failure</a></h3>
	The presence of an abnormality of cardiac function that is responsible for the failure of the heart to pump blood at a rate that is commensurate with the needs of the tissues or a state in which abnormally elevated filling pressures are required for the heart to do so. Heart failure is frequently related to a defect in myocardial contraction.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001297" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Stroke</a></h3>
	Sudden impairment of blood flow to a part of the brain due to occlusion or rupture of an artery to the brain.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001279" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Syncope</a></h3>
	Syncope refers to a generalized weakness of muscles with loss of postural tone, inability to stand upright, and loss of consciousness. Once the patient is in a horizontal position, blood flow to the brain is no longer hindered by gravitation and consciousness is regained. Unconsciousness usually lasts for seconds to minutes. Headache and drowsiness (which usually follow seizures) do not follow a syncopal attack. Syncope results from a sudden impairment of brain metabolism usually due to a reduction in cerebral blood flow.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001681" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Angina pectoris</a></h3>
	Paroxysmal chest pain that occurs with exertion or stress and is related to myocardial ischemia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001962" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Palpitations</a></h3>
	A sensation that the heart is pounding or racing, which is a non-specific sign but may be a manifestation of arrhythmia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010741" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Edema of the lower limbs</a></h3>
	An abnormal accumulation of fluid beneath the skin of the legs.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001508" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Failure to thrive</a></h3>
	Failure to thrive (FTT) refers to a child whose physical growth is substantially below the norm.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Although there is no clear consensus on the exact definition of FTT, it is usually diagnoses in a child growing below the 3rd percentile or in a child whose decreased growth has cross two major growth percentiles (for example, from above the 75th percentile to below the 25th percentile).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002094" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dyspnea</a></h3>
	Difficult or labored breathing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003756" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Skeletal myopathy</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000505" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Visual impairment</a></h3>
	Visual impairment (or vision impairment) is vision loss (of a person) to such a degree as to qualify as an additional support need through a significant limitation of visual capability resulting from either disease, trauma, or congenital or degenerative conditions that cannot be corrected by conventional means, such as refractive correction, medication, or surgery.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000819" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Diabetes mellitus</a></h3>
	A group of abnormalities characterized by hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010880" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Increased nuchal translucency</a></h3>
	The presence of an abnormally large hypoechoic space in the posterior fetal neck (usually detected on prenatal ultrasound examination).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Increased nuchal translucency may be related to a cystic hygroma or to mesenchymal edema. Increased nuchal translucency can be classified into three categories: 1) cardiac abnormalities, combined with abnormal ductus venosus flow velocities, is found, leading to the theory that cardiac failure causes nuchal translucency enlargement; 2) various types of abnormalities are found in the extracellular matrix of the nuchal skin of fetuses with increased nuchal translucency; 3) abnormal lymphatic development is demonstrated in fetuses with increased nuchal translucency.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
