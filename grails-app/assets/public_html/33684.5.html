						<!-- <h2>Epidermolysis bullosa eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Patients with inherited skin fragility and a clinical diagnosis of EB of unknown cause<br />
•	Diagnosis confirmed by a consultant dermatologist

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Non-EB genetic causes including porphyria or photosensitivity syndromes<br />
•	Acquired causes including EB acquisita and bullous drug reactions

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
 KRT5, KRT14, PLEC, DSP, PKP1, JUP, TGM5, EXPH5, ITGA3, ITGA6, ITGB4, DST, COL17A1, LAMA3, LAMA3A, LAMB3, LAMC2, COL7A1

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

<br />
Comment:<br />
Mitten deformity is also referred to as pseudosyndactyly, which should not be confused with true syndactyly (actual and complete fusion of fingers). Antenatally, pseudosyndactyly can be misinterpreted as syndactyly.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001029" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Poikiloderma</a></h3>
	Poikiloderma refers to a patch of skin with (1) reticulated hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation, (2) wrinkling secondary to epidermal atrophy, and (3) telangiectasias.<br />
<br />

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001903" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anemia</a></h3>
	A reduction in erythrocytes volume or hemoglobin concentration.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Anemia is not a specific entity but can result from many underlying pathologic processes. The three main causes of anemia are blood loss, decreased or faulty red blood cell production, and increased destruction of red blood cells. Various classifications are in clinical use including a classification according to the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the erythrocytes: microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic. Anemias can also be classified according to variations in cell size and shape, as reflected by the red-cell distribution width (RDW). Additionally, anemias can be classified into those of inadequate production and hemolytic anemias.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000212" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Gingival overgrowth</a></h3>
	Hyperplasia of the gingiva (FMA:59762, that is, a thickening of the soft tissue overlying the alveolar ridge. The degree of thickening ranges from involvement of the interdental papillae alone to gingival overgrowth covering the entire tooth crown.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding is to be distinguished from overgrowth of the alveolar ridge.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010296" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ankyloglossia</a></h3>
	Short or anteriorly attached lingual frenulum, associated with limited mobility of the tongue.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The anterior third of the tongue is usually free or is partially attached to the floor of the mouth by the lingual frenulum. There is a spectrum ranging from fusion of the tongue to the floor of the mouth (ankyloglossia inferiorum) to a lingual frenulum that is short or anchored toward the tip of the tongue (sometimes called tongue tie). Ankyloglossia may be associated with a mild indentation of the tip of the tongue, which should not be coded as a Bifid tongue.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002671" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Basal cell carcinoma</a></h3>
	The presence of a basal cell carcinoma of the skin.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
A basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer which rarely metastasizes, but is still considered malignant because it can cause significant destruction and disfigurement by invading surrounding tissues. In 80 percent of all cases, basal cell cancers are found on the head and neck or on other sun-exposed areas of the body. Apart from sporadic basal cell carcinoma, there are hereditary conditions such as the basal cell nevus syndrome where patients develop multiple basal cell carcinomas throughout life.
