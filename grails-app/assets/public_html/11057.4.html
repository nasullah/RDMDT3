						<!-- <h2>IUGR Eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Height Standard Deviation Score (SDS) <-3 (very significant short stature - well below the 0.4th centile) AND<br />
- At least one of:<br />
  - being born small for gestational (birth weight and/or length <-2SDS), Â± a history of intra-uterine growth restriction<br />
  - Body disproportion - e.g. discrepancy between stature and head size, limb to spine disproportion, limb asymmetry<br />
  - Dysmorphic features e.g. facial dysmorphism, polydactyly/syndactyly, ear abnormalities<br />
  - Aberration in the GH-IGF axis (evidence of GH insensitivity or deficiency)<br />
  - Other pituitary hormonal deficiencies<br />
  - Family history (short stature that is explained or idiopathic in parents, affected siblings,cousins) and/or consanguinity<br />
  - Other features such as cleft palate, hearing loss, visual impairment with eye abnormalities including anophthalmia/microphthalmia, optic nerve hypoplasia, retinal dystrophy, forebrain abnormalities and learning difficulties<br />
- For all patients with no abnormalities of the GH-IGF-I axis classified as Idiopathic Short Stature or who are small for gestational age with failure of catch up growth, a skeletal survey should be performed.

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Acquired causes of short stature, e.g. autoimmune, intracranial neoplasia, infective causes such as Group B Streptococcal meningitis, Langerhans cell Histiocytosis, trauma, previous treatment for malignancy including irradiation, exogenous glucocorticoid use, psychosocial growth failure, chronic disease<br />
- Syndromes associated with short stature such as Turner syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Down syndrome, other chromosomal disorders. However, if the patient has a clinical diagnosis of, e.g. Noonan syndrome, and testing of known genes associated with the syndrome has not identified a pathogenic mutation, then they should be included in the 100000 genomes study. <br />
- Foetal alcohol syndrome <br />
- Genetically proven skeletal dysplasias such as hypochondroplasia or achondroplasia<br />
- Genetically proven Silver-Russell syndrome

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
- All patients with short stature and other features such as developmental delay and dysmorphism should have a DNA microarray with no pathogenic copy number variants detected prior to enrolment<br />
  - Additional genetic testing should have been performed as appropriate

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

						<!-- <h2>IUGR Phenotypes</h2> -->

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001511" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intrauterine growth retardation</a></h3>
	An abnormal restriction of fetal growth with fetal weight below the tenth percentile for gestational age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Intrauterine growth restriction is a newer term that is preferred over Intrauterine growth retardation. The causes of IUGR include maternal abnormalities (chronic hypertension, cyanotic heart disease, smoking, drug abuse), placental or umbilical cord abnormalities (including placenta previa and cord anomalies), maternal medicationas, and genetic disorders of the fetus.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001508" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Failure to thrive</a></h3>
	Failure to thrive (FTT) refers to a child whose physical growth is substantially below the norm.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Although there is no clear consensus on the exact definition of FTT, it is usually diagnoses in a child growing below the 3rd percentile or in a child whose decreased growth has cross two major growth percentiles (for example, from above the 75th percentile to below the 25th percentile).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004322" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short stature</a></h3>
	A height below that which is expected according to age and gender norms. Although there is no universally accepted definition of short stature, many refer to "short stature" as height more than 2 standard deviations below the mean for age and gender (or below the 3rd percentile for age and gender dependent norms).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000028" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cryptorchidism</a></h3>
	Testis in inguinal canal. That is, absence of one or both testes from the scrotum owing to failure of the testis or testes to descend through the inguinal canal to the testis.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The gonad is mobile and can be retracted superiorly by the cremaster muscle reflex stimulated, for instance, by cold or touch. A retracted testis is not cryptorchidism. An abdominal testis cannot be distinguished by physical examination from an (Apparently) absent testis and requires radiological (or, rarely, surgical) procedures for assessment.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000047" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypospadias</a></h3>
	Displacement of the urethral opening on the ventral (inferior) surface of the penis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000054" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Micropenis</a></h3>
	Abnormally small penis. At birth, the normal penis is about 3 cm (stretched length from pubic tubercle to tip of penis) with micropenis less than 2.0-2.5 cm.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000823" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Delayed puberty</a></h3>
	Passing the age when puberty normally occurs with no physical or hormonal signs of the onset of puberty.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The age at which delayed puberty may be diagnosed in a person without signs of secondary sexual development is 13 years in a girl or 14 years in a boy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000826" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Precocious puberty</a></h3>
	The onset of secondary sexual characteristics before a normal age. Although it is difficult to define normal age ranges because of the marked variation with which puberty begins in normal children, precocious puberty can be defined as the onset of puberty before the age of 8 years in girls or 9 years in boys.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012412" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Premature adrenarche</a></h3>
	Onset of adrenarche at an earlier age than usual.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Adrenarche is an early sexual maturation stage that typically occurs at around 6 to 8 years of age, during which the adrenal cortex begins to secrete increased levels of androgens resulting from the development of the zona reticularis in the adrenal cortex. Note that pubarche refers to the development of pubic hair, axillary hair, and adult sweat gland (apocrine) odor. The physical features associated with pubarche reflect the onset of adrenarche, which refers to the pubertal maturation of the adrenal and is associated with increased secretion of an adrenal hormone called dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001871" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of blood and blood-forming tissues</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the hematopoietic system.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The hematopoietic system comprises the organs that are involved in the production of blood, primarily the bone marrow, spleen, tonsils, and lymph nodes.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002846" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of B cells</a></h3>
	An abnormality of B cells.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
B-cells are lymphocytes whose principle function in the adaptive immune system is to make antibodies against antigens.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002843" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of T cells</a></h3>
	An abnormality of T cells.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
T-cells are lymphocytes whose principle function in the adaptive immune system is to mediate cell-mediated immunity.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002718" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent bacterial infections</a></h3>
	Increased susceptibility to bacterial infections, as manifested by recurrent episodes of bacterial infection.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000403" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent otitis media</a></h3>
	Increased susceptibility to otitis media, as manifested by recurrent episodes of otitis media.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000010" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent urinary tract infections</a></h3>
	Repeated infections of the urinary tract.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The urinary tract comprises the kidneys, ureters, a bladder, and a urethra.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000458" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anosmia</a></h3>
	An inability to perceive odors. This is a general term describing inability to smell arising in any part of the process of smelling from absorption of odorants into the nasal mucous overlying the olfactory epithelium, diffusion to the cilia, binding to olfactory receptor sites, generation of action potentials in olfactory neurons, and perception of a smell.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000505" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Visual impairment</a></h3>
	Visual impairment (or vision impairment) is vision loss (of a person) to such a degree as to qualify as an additional support need through a significant limitation of visual capability resulting from either disease, trauma, or congenital or degenerative conditions that cannot be corrected by conventional means, such as refractive correction, medication, or surgery.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002301" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hemiplegia</a></h3>
	Paralysis (complete loss of muscle function) in the arm, leg, and in some cases the face on one side of the body.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
	A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000750" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Delayed speech and language development</a></h3>
	A degree of language development that is significantly below the norm for a child of a specified age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Language delay can be characterized by a failure to meet the developmental milestones for language development, an inability to follow directions, or slow or incomprehensible speech after the age of three years, as well as with severe problems with syntax or articulation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001328" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Specific learning disability</a></h3>
	Impairment of certain skills such as reading or writing, coordination, self-control, or attention that interfere with the ability to learn. The impairment is not related to a global deficiency of intelligence.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term learning disability is used with different meanings in different contexts. Significant impairments of mental functioning with a reduction in IQ below 70 should be coded as mental retardation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007018" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a></h3>
	Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) manifests at age 2-3 years or by first grade at the latest. The main symptoms are distractibility, impulsivity, hyperactivity, and often trouble organizing tasks and projects, difficulty going to sleep, and social problems from being aggressive, loud, or impatient.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000729" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Autistic behavior</a></h3>
	A disorder beginning in childhood. It is marked by the presence of markedly abnormal or impaired development in social interaction and communication and a markedly restricted repertoire of activity and interest. Manifestations of the disorder vary greatly depending on the developmental level and chronological age of the individual (DSM-IV).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term can be used to refer to autism spectrum disorder as a phenotypic feature that can be a component of a disease. Autism spectrum disorder range from a severe form, called autistic disorder, to a milder form, Asperger syndrome.
