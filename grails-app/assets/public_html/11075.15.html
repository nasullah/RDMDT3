  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Relevant diseases:

- Early onset pancytopenia and red cell disorders
- Congenital anaemias</p>

  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Anaemia on more than one occasion</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Evidence that the anaemia is acquired (e.g. low B12, folate or ferritin or cytogenetic abnormalities)</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 - As appropriate based on presentation
  - e.g. Sideroblastic anaemia - ALAS2, SLC25A38;
  - Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia - C15orf41, CDAN1, GATA1</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001903" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anemia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A reduction in erythrocytes volume or hemoglobin concentration.

Comment:
Anemia is not a specific entity but can result from many underlying pathologic processes. The three main causes of anemia are blood loss, decreased or faulty red blood cell production, and increased destruction of red blood cells. Various classifications are in clinical use including a classification according to the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the erythrocytes: microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic. Anemias can also be classified according to variations in cell size and shape, as reflected by the red-cell distribution width (RDW). Additionally, anemias can be classified into those of inadequate production and hemolytic anemias.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001876" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pancytopenia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormal reduction in numbers of all blood cell types (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001924" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sideroblastic anemia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Sideroblastic anemia results from a defect in the incorporation of iron into the heme molecule. A sideroblast is an erythroblast that has stainable deposits of iron in cytoplasm (this can be demonstrated by Prussian blue staining).

Comment:
Sideroblastic anemia may be either congenital or acquired. In sideroblastic anemia, the hematocrit tends to be around 20 to 30 percent, and the mean corpuscular volume is normal or low.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005532" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Macrocytic dyserythropoietic anemia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001873" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Thrombocytopenia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A reduction in the number of circulating thrombocytes.

Comment:
Thrombocytopenia can be divided into three major causes; 1) low production of platelets in the bone marrow; 2) intravascular breakdown of thrombocytes; and 3) increased turnover of platelets in spleen or liver (extravascular).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001882" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Leukopenia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormal decreased number of leukocytes in the blood.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006579" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Prolonged neonatal jaundice</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Neonatal jaundice refers to a yellowing of the skin and other tissues of a newborn infant as a result of increased concentrations of bilirubin in the blood. Neonatal jaundice affects over half of all newborns to some extent in the first week of life. Prolonged neonatal jaundice is said to be present if the jaundice persists for longer than 14 days in term infants and 21 days in preterm infants.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002719" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent infections</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Increased susceptibility to microbial infections, as manifested by recurrent episodes of infection.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002721" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Immunodeficiency</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001508" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Failure to thrive</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Failure to thrive (FTT) refers to a child whose physical growth is substantially below the norm.

Comment:
Although there is no clear consensus on the exact definition of FTT, it is usually diagnoses in a child growing below the 3rd percentile or in a child whose decreased growth has cross two major growth percentiles (for example, from above the 75th percentile to below the 25th percentile).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.

Comment:
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).</p>
