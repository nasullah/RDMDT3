						<!-- <h2>Anophthalmia Eligibility</h2> -->
Relevant diseases:<br />
<br />
- Anophthalmia/microphthalmia<br />
<br />
<br />
Anophthalmia (clinical absence of the eye) and severe microphthalmia (congenital reduction in the overall size of the globe) represent clinically significant inborn errors of early development.

<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Unilateral or bilateral anophthalmia or microphthalmia

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>


<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
- Genome-wide copy number variation (e.g. aCGH, SNP array or other genomic microarray)<br />
 - SOX2, OTX2 (severe, bilateral cases)

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

A congenital, unilateral or bilateral congenital condition caused by incomplete closure of the embryonic fissure.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cataract</a></h3>
	A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010700" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Total cataract</a></h3>
	A Congenital cataract characterized by an opacity of all the fibers of a lens.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100018" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nuclear cataract</a></h3>
	A nuclear cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the lens nucleus. That is, a nuclear cataract is one that is located in the center of the lens. The nucleus tends to darken changing from clear to yellow and sometimes brown.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100019" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cortical cataract</a></h3>
	A cataract which affects the layer of the lens surrounding the nucleus, i.e., the lens cortex. It is identified by its unique wedge or spoke appearance.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010922" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Membranous cataract</a></h3>
	A form of cataract in which the lens substance has shrunk, leaving a collapsed, flattened capsule with little or no cortex or epithelium on the lens.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010696" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Polar cataract</a></h3>
	A type of Congenital cataract in which the opacities occupy the subcapsular cortex at the anterior or posterior pole of the lens.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000523" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Subcapsular cataract</a></h3>
	A cataract that affects the region of the lens directly beneath the capsule of the lens.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007971" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Lamellar cataract</a></h3>
	A congenital cataract in which opacity is limited to layers of the lens external to the nucleus (i.e., the perinuclear region), i.e., between the nuclear and cortical layers of the lens.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010693" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pulverulent Cataract</a></h3>
	A kind of congenital cataract that is characterized by a hollow sphere of punctate opacities involving the fetal nucleus and that usually occurs bilaterally.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The word "pulverulent " means dust-like and refers to the dustlike appearance of the punctate opacities in this type of cataract. The word pulverulent refers to the very small size of the punctate opacities (like flecks of dust) rather than to a dust-like color.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004328" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the anterior segment of the eye</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the anterior segment of the eye.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The anterior segment comprises the structures in front of the vitreous humour: the cornea, iris, ciliary body, and lens.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011493" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Central opacification of the cornea</a></h3>
	Reduced transparency of the central portion of the corneal stroma.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007700" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anterior segment dysgenesis</a></h3>
	Abnormal development (dysgenesis) of the anterior segment of the eye globe. These structures are mainly of mesenchymal origin.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
In anterior segment mesenchymal ocular dysgenesis (ASMOD), multiple tissues are affected, including the iris, cornea, and lens as well as the Schlemm's canal and trabecular meshwork drainage structures located at the anterior segment angle where the iris and cornea meet. These abnormalities may result from a primary defect in the migration and/or differentiation of the mesenchymal cells that contribute to development of the cornea, iris, and drainage structures.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008063" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the lens</a></h3>

	A congenital anomaly in which a part or the whole of the cornea acquires the characteristics of sclera, resulting in clouding of the cornea.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004329" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the posterior segment of the eye</a></h3>
	The posterior segment comprises the anterior hyaloid membrane and all of the optical structures behind it: the vitreous humor, retina, choroid, and optic nerve.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000493" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the fovea</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the fovea centralis, the central area of the macula that mediates central, high resolution vision and contains the largest concentration of cone cells in the retina.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008058" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the optic nerve</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007973" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Retinal dysplasia</a></h3>
	The presence of developmental dysplasia of the retina.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This feature is a  congenital developmental anomaly of the retina characterized by abnormal growth and differentiation. The retina contains numerous tubular structures and rosettes. Retinal dysplasia (synonym: retinal dysgenesis) is often accompanied by retinal detachment and micropthalmos, but the latter features should be coded separately.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001093" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Optic nerve dysplasia</a></h3>
	The presence of developmental dysplasia of the optic nerve.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007968" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous</a></h3>
	A failure of regression of the hyaloid vessel, which supplies the primary vitreous during embryogenesis and normally regresses in the third trimester of pregnancy, leading to a particular form of posterior cataract. This condition is known as Persistent Hyperplastic Primary Vitreous (PHPV).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030244" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Maternal fever in pregnancy</a></h3>
	The occurence of an elevated body temperature of the mother during pregnancy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
There is evidence to suugest that maternal fever during pregnancy may negatively affect offspring healthneural tube defects, congenital heart defects, and oral clefts, in which meta-analyses suggested between a 1.5- and nearly 3-fold increased risk with fever exposure in the first trimester.
