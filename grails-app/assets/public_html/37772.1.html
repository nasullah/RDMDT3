NB. Clinical test guidance:<br />
General biopsy refers to biopsy of abnormal intestinal features <br />

<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Proven histological evidence of epithelial disorder on gut biopsy: Epithelial dysmorphology characterised by e.g. epithelial detachment abnormal epithelial cell polarisation, epithelial cell crowding/tufting and increased apoptotic activity of the epithelial layer.

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Evidence of primary immune deficiency. <br />
•	Histopathology in keeping with conventional GI disorders such as IBD without features described above.

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
 •	EPCAM, MYO5B, ADAM17, IKBKG

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
 •	EPCAM, MYO5B, ADAM17, IKBKG

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001508" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Failure to thrive</a></h3>
	Failure to thrive (FTT) refers to a child whose physical growth is substantially below the norm.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Although there is no clear consensus on the exact definition of FTT, it is usually diagnoses in a child growing below the 3rd percentile or in a child whose decreased growth has cross two major growth percentiles (for example, from above the 75th percentile to below the 25th percentile).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001510" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Growth delay</a></h3>
	A deficiency or slowing down of growth pre- and postnatally.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Poor or abnormally slow gains in weight or height in a child.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001561" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Polyhydramnios</a></h3>
	The presence of excess amniotic fluid in the uterus during pregnancy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Polyhydramnios is diagnosed if the deepest vertical pool of amniotic fluid is more than 8 cm or amniotic fluid index is more than 95th percentile for the corresponding gestational age.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002041" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intractable diarrhea</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003270" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abdominal distention</a></h3>
	Distention of the abdomen.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Abdominal distention can be a secondary feature associated with a number of conditions such as bowel obstruction.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002243" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Protein-losing enteropathy</a></h3>
	Abnormal loss of protein from the digestive tract related to excessive leakage of plasma proteins into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Affected individuals may present with peripheral edema, diarrhea with or without bleeding, abdominal pain, and/or weight loss. Protein-losing enteropathy is not a disease but is a manifestation of a number of gastrointestinal diseases and can be related to factors such as lymphatic obstruction, mucosal disease with erosions, ulcerations, or increased mucosal permeability to proteins.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002037" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Inflammation of the large intestine</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004387" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Enterocolitis</a></h3>
	An inflammation of the colon and small intestine. However, most conditions are either categorized as Enteritis (inflammation of the small intestine) or Colitis (inflammation of the large intestine).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002027" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abdominal pain</a></h3>
	An unpleasant sensation characterized by physical discomfort (such as pricking, throbbing, or aching) and perceived to originate in the abdomen.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011100" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intestinal atresia</a></h3>
	An abnormal closure, or atresia of the tubular structure of the intestine.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Intestinal atresia is a broad term used to describe a complete blockage or obstruction anywhere in the intestine, in contrast to stenosis, which refers to a partial obstruction that results in a narrowing of the intestinal lumen.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004395" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Malnutrition</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Small for gestational age</a></h3>
	Smaller than normal size according to sex and gestational age related norms, defined as a weight below the 10th percentile for the gestational age.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011473" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Villous atrophy</a></h3>
	The enteric villi are atrophic or absent.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002960" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Autoimmunity</a></h3>
	The occurrence of an immune reaction against the organism's own cells or tissues.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002721" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Immunodeficiency</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012649" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Increased inflammatory response</a></h3>
	A abnormal increase in the inflammatory response to injury or infection.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003565" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003203" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Negative nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction test</a></h3>
	In the NBT test, neutrophils change the colorless compound NBT into a compound with a deep blue color. If this test is negative (i.e., no blue color is produced), then this indicates a defect in superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase activity with inability to efficiently kill phagocytized bacteria.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The NBT test measures the ability of neutrophils to convert nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), to a deep blue color. This test can be abnormal in chronic granulomatous disease.
