Imaging diagnostics refers to Brain MRI</p>

  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">-Recurrent hypersomnia: 
-Recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness lasting for 2 days-4 weeks 
-Episodes recur at least once per year -Alertness, cognitive function and behavior are normal between episodes 
-Hypersomnia 
-AND at least 1 of the following: 
-Cognitive abnormalities 
– ex confusion, derealisation(“déjà vu” during episodes, dream-like state or experiencing out of body hallucinations 
-Abnormal behaviour – irritability, aggression 
-Hyperphagia 
OR 
-Recurrent daytime hypersomnia: 
-Sudden onset of sleep or &quot;sleep attacks&quot; 
-Other symptoms can include cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations and Sleep paralysis 
-A positive family history 
OR 
-Involuntary kicking and jerking movements of the legs and arms often repeated 100s of times during the night 
-Unaware of their multiple night-time awakenings unless they are witnessed by a bed partner 
-In extreme cases these brief arousals following the leg movements disturb sleep so much that they cause excessive daytime sleepiness 
-A +ve family history 
OR 
-The symptoms of parasomnias: 
-Sleepwalking—takes place during deep sleep, not REM sleep when dreams typically occur 
-Night terrors—these severe attacks cause people, usually children, to appear to wake up and scream in fear or panic 
-Sleep-eating disorders—these episodes occur during partial awakenings from deep sleep and cause individuals to eat without any knowledge of what they are doing. 
-A +ve family history Individuals with severe or syndromic disease should be recruited according to standard guidance, typically as trios. 
Disease status of apparently unaffected participants should be determined according to standard clinical practice to detect cryptic disease. In other cases, unaffected individuals should not be recruited. Recruitment in such families should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- No structural or inflammatory (MS-like) lesions on brain MRI.
- No atypical depression
- No sleep disorders (exclude Narcolepsy and Menstruation-related hypersomnia)
- No substance abuse (particularly benzodiazepine)
- No temporal lobe epilepsy
- Metabolic Encephalopathy
- Lyme disease
- Acute intermittent porphyria</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007200" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Episodic hypersomnia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001197" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of prenatal development or birth</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of the fetus or the birth of the fetus, excluding structural abnormalities.

Comment:
Because of the close link between prenatal developmental abnormalities and abnormalities of the birth process, a single term is chosen to subsume both classes of abnormality.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.

Comment:
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term &#39;psychomotor retardation&#39; is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000708" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Behavioral abnormality</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of mental functioning including various affective, behavioural, cognitive and perceptual abnormalities.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002591" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Polyphagia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A neurological anomaly with gross overeating associated with an abnormally strong desire or need to eat.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormal shift in patterns of thinking, acting, or feeling.

Comment:
This term refers to changes in personality that are perceived as being abnormal. It does not refer to the usual gradual personality changes that tend to accompany aging and certain life situations.</p>

The nervous system comprises the neuraxis (brain, spinal cord, and ventricles), the autonomic nervous system, the enteric nervous system, and the peripheral nervous system.</p>
