  <p class="preserve-new-lines">NB. Clinical test guidance:
Imaging diagnostsics refers to MRI brain and/or medical photographs of facial features and other physical features as appropriate</p>

  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Moderate to Severe/ Profound ID disproportionate to parental IQ unless the family history is consistent with an X-linked disorder
- Congenital onset
- Developmental Delay
- +/- clinical features suggestive of a specific syndrome
- Metabolic causes have been excluded</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Antenatal history suggestive of non-genetic cause
- Proven congenital or neonatal infections
- Known genetic cause already identified
- Microarray analysis abnormal and clearly pathogenic</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 - For syndromes where the cause of disease is 1-2 genes these need to be excluded before Genomics England recruitment, e.g. for Kabuki syndrome, MLL2 (KMT2D) and KDM6A should have been tested</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.

Comment:
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.

Comment:
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term &#39;psychomotor retardation&#39; is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010862" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Delayed fine motor development</a></h3>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000750" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Delayed speech and language development</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A degree of language development that is significantly below the norm for a child of a specified age.

Comment:
Language delay can be characterized by a failure to meet the developmental milestones for language development, an inability to follow directions, or slow or incomprehensible speech after the age of three years, as well as with severe problems with syntax or articulation.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000729" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Autistic behavior</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A disorder beginning in childhood. It is marked by the presence of markedly abnormal or impaired development in social interaction and communication and a markedly restricted repertoire of activity and interest. Manifestations of the disorder vary greatly depending on the developmental level and chronological age of the individual (DSM-IV).

Comment:
This term can be used to refer to autism spectrum disorder as a phenotypic feature that can be a component of a disease. Autism spectrum disorder range from a severe form, called autistic disorder, to a milder form, Asperger syndrome.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Small for gestational age</a></h3>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Failure to thrive (FTT) refers to a child whose physical growth is substantially below the norm.

Comment:
Although there is no clear consensus on the exact definition of FTT, it is usually diagnoses in a child growing below the 3rd percentile or in a child whose decreased growth has cross two major growth percentiles (for example, from above the 75th percentile to below the 25th percentile).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003498" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Disproportionate short stature</a></h3>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001520" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Large for gestational age</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The term large for gestational age applies to babies whose birth weight lies above the 90th percentile for that gestational age.

Comment:
Fetal macrosomia has been defined in several different ways, including birth weight of 4000-4500 g (8 lb 13 oz to 9 lb 15 oz) or greater than 90% for gestational age after correcting for neonatal sex and ethnicity. Based on these definitions, macrosomia affects 1-10% of all pregnancies. A diagnosis of fetal macrosomia can be made only by measuring birth weight after delivery; therefore, the condition is confirmed only retrospectively, ie, after delivery of the neonate.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000098" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Tall stature</a></h3>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.

Comment:
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000256" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Macrocephaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Occipitofrontal (head) circumference greater than 97th centile compared to appropriate, age matched, sex-matched normal standards. Alternatively, a apparently increased size of the cranium.

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010880" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Increased nuchal translucency</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The presence of an abnormally large hypoechoic space in the posterior fetal neck (usually detected on prenatal ultrasound examination).

Comment:
Increased nuchal translucency may be related to a cystic hygroma or to mesenchymal edema. Increased nuchal translucency can be classified into three categories: 1) cardiac abnormalities, combined with abnormal ductus venosus flow velocities, is found, leading to the theory that cardiac failure causes nuchal translucency enlargement; 2) various types of abnormalities are found in the extracellular matrix of the nuchal skin of fetuses with increased nuchal translucency; 3) abnormal lymphatic development is demonstrated in fetuses with increased nuchal translucency.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The presence of excess amniotic fluid in the uterus during pregnancy.

Comment:
Polyhydramnios is diagnosed if the deepest vertical pool of amniotic fluid is more than 8 cm or amniotic fluid index is more than 95th percentile for the corresponding gestational age.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001562" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Oligohydramnios</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Diminished amniotic fluid volume in pregnancy.

Comment:
Oligohydramnios is the opposite of polyhydramnios. In normal pregnancy the amniotic fluid volume increases by about 10 ml/day until the 34th, after which it slowly diminishes. A normal amniotic fluid volume at term is about 500-2,000 ml. Oligohydramnios is defined as an AFI (amniotic fluid index) less than 5 cm or smallest vertical pocket of fluid less than 2 cm.</p>
