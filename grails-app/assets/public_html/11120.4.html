						<!-- <h2>Cystic kidney disease Eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
- >5 cysts affecting one or both kidneys OR <br />
- Kidney biopsy showing glomerulocystic kidney disease or interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy with no identified glomerular lesion<br />
AND<br />
- Unaffected individuals have undergone appropriate screening for cryptic disease e.g. renal ultrasound scan<br />
- Individuals with severe or syndromic disease should be recruited according to standard guidance, preferably as trios<br />
- In other cases, unaffected individuals should not be recruited. Recruitment in such families should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs.

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
- Advanced or end-stage kidney failure due to identified (non-cystic) disease<br />
- Multicystic dysplastic kidney(s) (see CAKUT)

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
- If kidneys enlarged for age (or >12cm in length in adults), molecular screening of PKD1 and PKD2 must be negative, unless family history consistent with AR inheritance, in which case PKHD1 also screened

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012622" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Chronic kidney disease</a></h3>
	Functional anomaly of the kidney persisting for at least three months.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000112" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nephropathy</a></h3>
	A nonspecific term referring to disease or damage of the kidneys.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000107" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Renal cyst</a></h3>
	A fluid filled sac in the kidney.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000090" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nephronophthisis</a></h3>
	Presence of cysts at the corticomedullary junction of the kidney in combination with tubulointerstitial fibrosis.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Nephronophthisis is here regarded as a phenotypic feature. The disease of the same name results in progressive symmetrical destruction of the kidneys involving both the tubules and glomeruli.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000089" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Renal hypoplasia</a></h3>
	Hypoplasia of the kidney.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Oligomeganephronic renal hypoplasia differs from simple hypoplasia, in which the renal mass is reduced but the number of nephrons is normal.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005576" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Tubulointerstitial fibrosis</a></h3>
	Fibrosis that involves the tubules and interstitial tissue of the kidney.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding is usually shown by renal biopsy. Fibrosis involves an excess accumulation of extracellular matrix and usually results in loss of function when normal tissue is replaced with scar tissue.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000822" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypertension</a></h3>
	The presence of chronic increased pressure in the systemic arterial system.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic BP (140 mm Hg or higher), diastolic BP (90 mm Hg or higher), or both.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012585" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Renal atrophy</a></h3>
	Atrophy of the kidney.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100611" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Multiple glomerular cysts</a></h3>
	The presence of many cysts in the glomerulus of the kidney related to dilatation of the Bowman's capsule.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000092" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Tubular atrophy</a></h3>
	The presence of renal tubules with thick redundant basement membranes, or a reduction of greater than 50% in tubular diameter compared to surrounding non-atrophic tubules.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000105" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Enlarged kidneys</a></h3>
	An abnormal increase in the size of the kidney.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The main causes of large kidney are hydronephrosis, polycystic disease, renal cell carcinoma, nephroblastoma/Wilm's tumor (in children), and solitary cysts. If possible, a specific term should be used instead of this one.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000787" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nephrolithiasis</a></h3>
	The presence of calculi (stones) in the kidneys.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Urinary stone disease is caused by supersaturation of the urine by stone forming substances including calcium, oxalate, and uric acid. Crystals or foreign bodies can act as a nidus for further stone formation. THe resulting kidney stones (calculi) lead to symptoms if they become impacted in the ureter.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001737" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pancreatic cysts</a></h3>
	A cyst of the pancreas that possess a lining of mucous epithelium.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Pancreatic cysts are to be distinguished from pancreatic pseudocysts that do not possess a lining of mucous epithelium.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001997" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Gout</a></h3>
	Recurrent attacks of acute inflammatory arthritis of a joint  or set of joints caused by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood which crystallize and are deposited in joints, tendons, and surrounding tissues.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001513" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Obesity</a></h3>
	Body weight that is grossly above the acceptable or desirable weight, usually due to accumulation of excess fats in the body. The standards may vary with age, sex, genetic or cultural background. In the body mass index (BMI), a BMI greater than 30.0 kg/m2 is considered obese, and a BMI greater than 40.0 kg/m2 is considered morbidly obese.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012759" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neurodevelopmental abnormality</a></h3>
	A deviation from normal of the neurological development of a child, which may include any or all of the aspects of the development of personal, social, gross or fine motor, and cognitive abilities.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used to describe abnormalities with onset in the developmental period.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001634" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Mitral valve prolapse</a></h3>
	One or both of the leaflets (cusps) of the mitral valve bulges back into the left atrium upon contraction of the left ventricle.<br />
<br />

	Hemorrhage occurring between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Bleeding into the subarachnoid space the area between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain. Subarachnoid hemorrhage may occur spontaneously, usually from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm, or may result from head injury.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001342" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebral hemorrhage</a></h3>
	Hemorrhage into the parenchyma of the brain.<br />
<br />

<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that this term can include or combine variations in size and shape, with partial or complete absence of structures. It is preferable to describe the individual components, which are defined below. It is nonetheless a widely used bundled term and as such is retained here. The distinction of this finding from a marked degree of Hypospadias is an example of how this term can be problematic. Genetic gender is determined at fertilization, whereby the presence of a Y chromosome determines male gender. Normally, genetic gender determines gonadal gender which in turn determines phenotypic gender. Testicular development is an active process requiring expression of the primary testis determining gene SRY, which is located on the Y chromosome.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000458" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anosmia</a></h3>
	An inability to perceive odors. This is a general term describing inability to smell arising in any part of the process of smelling from absorption of odorants into the nasal mucous overlying the olfactory epithelium, diffusion to the cilia, binding to olfactory receptor sites, generation of action potentials in olfactory neurons, and perception of a smell.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009794" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Branchial anomaly</a></h3>
	Congenital developmental defect arising from the primitive branchial apparatus.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
During embryonic development the major head and neck structures are formed from the five pharyngeal arches (bands of tissue). Incomplete, failed or persistent embryonic development of these arches results in several anomalies or defects in the neck.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000028" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cryptorchidism</a></h3>
	Testis in inguinal canal. That is, absence of one or both testes from the scrotum owing to failure of the testis or testes to descend through the inguinal canal to the testis.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The gonad is mobile and can be retracted superiorly by the cremaster muscle reflex stimulated, for instance, by cold or touch. A retracted testis is not cryptorchidism. An abdominal testis cannot be distinguished by physical examination from an (Apparently) absent testis and requires radiological (or, rarely, surgical) procedures for assessment.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000819" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Diabetes mellitus</a></h3>
	A group of abnormalities characterized by hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000356" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the outer ear</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the external ear.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001999" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal facial shape</a></h3>
	An abnormal morphology (form) of the face or its components.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term now covers many of the historical inexact descriptions such as Bird-like facies that probably should be avoided in modern genetics. This portion of the Ontology should be revised.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
	A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000135" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypogonadism</a></h3>
	A decreased functionality of the gonad.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Reduced functioning of the gonads (ovaries or testes) with reduced production of sex hormones.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000478" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the eye</a></h3>
	Any abnormality of the eye, including location, spacing, and intraocular abnormalities.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001696" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Situs inversus totalis</a></h3>
	A left-right reversal (or "mirror reflection") of the anatomical location of the major thoracic and abdominal organs.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004737" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global glomerulosclerosis</a></h3>
	Complete and diffuse scarring of glomerulus.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
All portions of all glomeruli are affected.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001970" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Tubulointerstitial nephritis</a></h3>
	A form of inflammation of the kidney affecting the interstitium of the kidneys surrounding the tubules.
