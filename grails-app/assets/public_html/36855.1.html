						<!-- <h2>Unexplained kidney failure in young people eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Requirement for renal replacement therapy (dialysis or kidney transplantation) at age < 50 years in the absence of an identified cause<br />
<br />
Recruitment guidance:<br />
•	Unaffected individuals have undergone appropriate screening for cryptic disease<br />
•	Individuals with paediatric onset of kidney failure or evidence of syndromic disease should be recruited according to standard guidance.<br />
•	In other cases, unaffected individuals should not be recruited.<br />
•	Recruitment in such families should favour families with multiple affected individuals available to participate in the study over singletons. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied per GMC but will be capped across the study at one third of the total genomes for the disorder.

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Likely or proven diabetic nephropathy<br />
•	Likely or proven renovascular disease<br />
•	Identified glomerular disorder on kidney biopsy (other than glomerulocystic disease, ischaemic changes or secondary glomerulosclerosis)<br />
•	Evidence autoimmune, infectious, malignant, metabolic or other systemic disorder likely to be responsible for kidney disease<br />
•	Renal sarcoidosis or tuberculosis<br />
•	Paraproteinaemia (unless kidney biopsy shows no evidence of renal monoclonal deposition)<br />
•	Exposure to nephrotoxin (drug or toxin) suspected of causing renal dysfunction<br />
•	Obstructive uropathy<br />
•	Significant proteinuria (>1g/day; uPCR >100) at presentation (see proteinuric renal disease inclusion criteria)<br />
•	Identified tubular/electrolyte/acid base disorder (see RTA/electrolyte disorder eligibility criteria)<br />
•	>5 kidney cysts (see cystic renal disease eligibility statement)<br />
•	Nephrolithiasis (see renal stone disease eligibility criteria)<br />
•	Congenital anomaly of kidney and urinary tract including reflux nephropathy (see CAKUT eligibility criteria)

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
 <br />
•	If personal or family history of gout under age of 30 in the absence of CKD stage 3, 4 or 5: UMOD<br />
•	If diabetes: HNF1B

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

Comment:<br />
Note that this term can include or combine variations in size and shape, with partial or complete absence of structures. It is preferable to describe the individual components, which are defined below. It is nonetheless a widely used bundled term and as such is retained here. The distinction of this finding from a marked degree of Hypospadias is an example of how this term can be problematic. Genetic gender is determined at fertilization, whereby the presence of a Y chromosome determines male gender. Normally, genetic gender determines gonadal gender which in turn determines phenotypic gender. Testicular development is an active process requiring expression of the primary testis determining gene SRY, which is located on the Y chromosome.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000458" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anosmia</a></h3>
	An inability to perceive odors. This is a general term describing inability to smell arising in any part of the process of smelling from absorption of odorants into the nasal mucous overlying the olfactory epithelium, diffusion to the cilia, binding to olfactory receptor sites, generation of action potentials in olfactory neurons, and perception of a smell.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009794" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Branchial anomaly</a></h3>
	Congenital developmental defect arising from the primitive branchial apparatus.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
During embryonic development the major head and neck structures are formed from the five pharyngeal arches (bands of tissue). Incomplete, failed or persistent embryonic development of these arches results in several anomalies or defects in the neck.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000028" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cryptorchidism</a></h3>
	Testis in inguinal canal. That is, absence of one or both testes from the scrotum owing to failure of the testis or testes to descend through the inguinal canal to the testis.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The gonad is mobile and can be retracted superiorly by the cremaster muscle reflex stimulated, for instance, by cold or touch. A retracted testis is not cryptorchidism. An abdominal testis cannot be distinguished by physical examination from an (Apparently) absent testis and requires radiological (or, rarely, surgical) procedures for assessment.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000819" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Diabetes mellitus</a></h3>
	A group of abnormalities characterized by hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000356" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the outer ear</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the external ear.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001999" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal facial shape</a></h3>
	An abnormal morphology (form) of the face or its components.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term now covers many of the historical inexact descriptions such as Bird-like facies that probably should be avoided in modern genetics. This portion of the Ontology should be revised.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
	A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000135" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypogonadism</a></h3>
	A decreased functionality of the gonad.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Reduced functioning of the gonads (ovaries or testes) with reduced production of sex hormones.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000478" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the eye</a></h3>
	Any abnormality of the eye, including location, spacing, and intraocular abnormalities.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001696" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Situs inversus totalis</a></h3>
	A left-right reversal (or "mirror reflection") of the anatomical location of the major thoracic and abdominal organs.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012622" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Chronic kidney disease</a></h3>
	Functional anomaly of the kidney persisting for at least three months.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000107" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Renal cyst</a></h3>
	A fluid filled sac in the kidney.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000090" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nephronophthisis</a></h3>
	Presence of cysts at the corticomedullary junction of the kidney in combination with tubulointerstitial fibrosis.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Nephronophthisis is here regarded as a phenotypic feature. The disease of the same name results in progressive symmetrical destruction of the kidneys involving both the tubules and glomeruli.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001997" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Gout</a></h3>
	Recurrent attacks of acute inflammatory arthritis of a joint  or set of joints caused by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood which crystallize and are deposited in joints, tendons, and surrounding tissues.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000822" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypertension</a></h3>
	The presence of chronic increased pressure in the systemic arterial system.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic BP (140 mm Hg or higher), diastolic BP (90 mm Hg or higher), or both.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012585" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Renal atrophy</a></h3>
	Atrophy of the kidney.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100611" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Multiple glomerular cysts</a></h3>
	The presence of many cysts in the glomerulus of the kidney related to dilatation of the Bowman's capsule.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001513" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Obesity</a></h3>
	Body weight that is grossly above the acceptable or desirable weight, usually due to accumulation of excess fats in the body. The standards may vary with age, sex, genetic or cultural background. In the body mass index (BMI), a BMI greater than 30.0 kg/m2 is considered obese, and a BMI greater than 40.0 kg/m2 is considered morbidly obese.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.
