•	Normal infection screen (including parvovirus, CMB, rubella +- syphilis, VZV), AND
•	No evidence of Rh or other blood group incompatibility, AND
•	Haemoglobinopathy excluded where present in parent, AND
•	Normal fetal +- neonatal amniotic fluid screen for storage disorders (glycosaminglycans), AND
•	If IUGR: normal placental artery dopplers AND middle cerebral artery Doppler &lt;1.5MoM

Please note: samples from ongoing pregnancies should NOT be included</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Isolated structural cardiac anomaly or cardiac arrhythmia
•	Fetal tumour
•	Fetal lung mass
•	Maternal pre-eclampsia
•	Poorly controlled maternal DM/hypothyroidism
•	Twin-twin transfusion</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
- Consideration of RASopathy screen (low threshold for PTPN11 exons 3 &amp; 8)
- Low threshold Niemann Pick analysis if splenomegaly or Ashkenazi ancestry</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001789" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hydrops fetalis</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The abnormal accumulation of fluid in two or more fetal compartments, including ascites, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and skin edema.

Comment:
The most common causes of hydrops fetalis are hematologic (inclusing isoimmunization because of Rhesus incompatibility and other causes), hereditary hemolytic disorders, fetal hemorrhage, disorders of red cell production), cardiovascular disorders, infections, certain intrathoracic malformations, and idiopathic forms.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A type of hydrops fetalis in which there is no identifiable circulating antibody to red blood cell antigens .</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010878" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Fetal cystic hygroma</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The presence during the prenatal period of a cystic mass with multiple septa with multiple, asymmetric, thin-walled cysts near the posterior aspect of the neck. Fetal cystic hygroma can be defined as nuchal translucency with or without septations measuring greater than 3.0 mm.

Comment:
Upon ultrasound examination, fetal cystic hygroma presents as a cystic mass with multiple septa with multiple, asymmetric, thin-walled cysts related to the posterior aspect of the neck. Cystic hygromas can range from increased nuchal translucency to thin-walled cystic masses that may become larger than the fetal head. The cysts may result from a lymphatic abnormality, possibly one caused by absent or inefficient connections between the lymphatic and venous systems. Depending on the site, the cut off may vary from site to site. Lowest would be 2.5 mm and highest 3.5 mm.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An first-trimester prenatal ultrasound finding of abnormal blood flow in the ductus venosus.

Comment:
The ductus venosus is a bypass between the umbilical vein and the inferior vena cava in the fetus. The blood flow through this bypass decreases immediately after birth. Functional closure, which is followed by anatomic closure, is virtually complete within a few weeks of birth. The typical abnormal finding in abnormal ductus venosus flow is a reversed a-wave.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002804" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A non-progressive finding characterized by multiple joint contractures found throughout the body at birth.

Comment:
Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is related to fetal akinesia owing to fetal neurogenic, muscle, or connective tissue disorders or occasionally to maternal conditions. AMC can be associated with polyhydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, micrognathia, ocular hypertelorism, and short umbilical cord. AMC is a feature of a heterogeneous group of disorders, some of which have the phrase &#39;arthrogryposis multiplex congenita&#39; as a part of their name (for instance, Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, distal type 1 or AMCD1). This term refers to the finding of multiple joint contractures found throughout the body at birth rather than to the disease entities of which this is a clinical feature.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001561" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Polyhydramnios</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The presence of excess amniotic fluid in the uterus during pregnancy.

Comment:
Polyhydramnios is diagnosed if the deepest vertical pool of amniotic fluid is more than 8 cm or amniotic fluid index is more than 95th percentile for the corresponding gestational age.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001562" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Oligohydramnios</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Diminished amniotic fluid volume in pregnancy.

Comment:
Oligohydramnios is the opposite of polyhydramnios. In normal pregnancy the amniotic fluid volume increases by about 10 ml/day until the 34th, after which it slowly diminishes. A normal amniotic fluid volume at term is about 500-2,000 ml. Oligohydramnios is defined as an AFI (amniotic fluid index) less than 5 cm or smallest vertical pocket of fluid less than 2 cm.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A short femur length is defined as either a measurement below the 2.5th percentile for gestational age or a measurement that is less than 0.9 of that predicted by the measured biparietal diameter. The femur should be measured with the bone perpendicular to the ultrasound beam and with epiphyseal cartilages visible but not included in the measurement (pmid:16100637).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011429" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short fetal humerus length</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A short humerus length is defined as a length below the 2.5th percentile for gestational age or as a measurement less than 0.9 of that predicted by the measured biparietal diameter. The humerus should be measured with the bone perpendicular to the ultrasound beam and with epiphyseal cartilages visible but not included in the measurement (pmid:16100637).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.

Comment:
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000256" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Macrocephaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Occipitofrontal (head) circumference greater than 97th centile compared to appropriate, age matched, sex-matched normal standards. Alternatively, a apparently increased size of the cranium.

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010952" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Mild fetal ventriculomegaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A kind of ventriculomegaly occurring in the fetal period and usually diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound. Cerebral ventriculomegaly is defined by atrial measurements 10 mm or more. Mild ventriculomegaly (MVM) is defined as measurements between 10 and 15 mm. Measurements are obtained from an axial plane at the level of the thalamic nuclei just below the standard image to measure the BPD (pmid:16100637).

Comment:
A ventricular atrial diameter of more than 10 mm at 20-24 weeks of gestation has been accepted as defining ventriculomegaly because it represents at least 3 standard deviations above the mean (which is roughly 5 mm at 20-24 weeks of gestation). If the diameter is above 15 mm, the ventriculomegaly is considered to be severe. Amongst the most common causes of ventriculomegaly are impaired absorption of CSF, developmental cerebral defects, and destroyed brain tissue.</p>
