						<!-- <h2>Unexplained sudden death in the young eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Sudden death at age less than or equal to 40 (including Sudden Infant Death Syndrome), AND<br />
•	No diagnosis established on post mortem examination, AND<br />
•	Absence of a pre-existing condition to explain the death.<br />
•	Parents should be recruited under this category in paediatric cases if available<br />
•	In adult cases the deceased individual should be recruited as a singleton; if surviving relatives have a phenotype which points to a particular condition, they should be the focus of further investigation or recruitment to the programme. <br />
•	Surviving relatives must be available to provide appropriate consent.

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Death in the context of a known diagnosed disease or accident<br />
•	Cause of death determined by post mortem examination<br />
•	No post mortem examination carried out<br />
•	No DNA or frozen tissue stored at post mortem.

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
 No genes listed

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001645" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sudden cardiac death</a></h3>
	The heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating resulting in death within a short time period (generally within 1 h of symptom onset).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001279" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Syncope</a></h3>
	Syncope refers to a generalized weakness of muscles with loss of postural tone, inability to stand upright, and loss of consciousness. Once the patient is in a horizontal position, blood flow to the brain is no longer hindered by gravitation and consciousness is regained. Unconsciousness usually lasts for seconds to minutes. Headache and drowsiness (which usually follow seizures) do not follow a syncopal attack. Syncope results from a sudden impairment of brain metabolism usually due to a reduction in cerebral blood flow.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001626" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the cardiovascular system</a></h3>
	Any abnormality of the cardiovascular system.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The cardiovascular system consists of the heart, vasculature, and the lymphatic system.
