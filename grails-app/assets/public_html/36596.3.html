  <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>

  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Coarse facial features warranting further investigation -particularly those with other medical problems, additional dysmorphic facial features or intellectual disability, AND
•	Previous investigations to exclude metabolic disorder including a minimum of plasma amino acids, urine organic acids and urine GAGs, AND</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Known genetic aetiology
•	Untreated congenital hypothyroidism
•	Metabolic investigations indicative of likely inborn error of metabolism (these individuals should follow a metabolic pathway of investigation and recruitment)
•	Clinical features of an insulin resistance / lipodystrophy disorder, RASopathy or overgrowth disorder (these individuals should be investigated and recruited to the relevant specific rare disorder)</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 -	Guided by phenotype. There should be a low threshold for Ras-MAPK gene testing, and 11p15 methylation analysis should be considered
-	If clinical diagnosis of Pallister-Killian syndrome is considered likely, a skin biopsy for chromosome analysis should be performed prior to recruitment</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000280" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Coarse facial features</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Absence of fine and sharp appearance of brows, nose, lips, mouth, and chin, usually because of rounded and heavy features or thickened skin with or without thickening of subcutaneous and bony tissues.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002194" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Delayed gross motor development</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A type of motor delay characterized by an delay in acquiring the ability to control the large muscles of the body for walking, running, sitting, and crawling.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010862" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Delayed fine motor development</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A type of motor delay characterized by an delay in acquiring the ability to control the fingers and hands.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000750" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Delayed speech and language development</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A degree of language development that is significantly below the norm for a child of a specified age.

Comment:
Language delay can be characterized by a failure to meet the developmental milestones for language development, an inability to follow directions, or slow or incomprehensible speech after the age of three years, as well as with severe problems with syntax or articulation.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.

Comment:
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term &#39;psychomotor retardation&#39; is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.

Comment:
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008872" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Feeding difficulties in infancy</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Impaired feeding performance of an infant as manifested by difficulties such as weak and ineffective sucking, brief bursts of sucking, and falling asleep during sucking. There may be difficulties with chewing or maintaining attention.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Muscular hypotonia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Muscular hypotonia is an abnormally low muscle tone (the amount of tension or resistance to movement in a muscle), often involving reduced muscle strength. Hypotonia is characterized by a diminished resistance to passive stretching.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.

Comment:
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.

Comment:
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000505" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Visual impairment</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Visual impairment (or vision impairment) is vision loss (of a person) to such a degree as to qualify as an additional support need through a significant limitation of visual capability resulting from either disease, trauma, or congenital or degenerative conditions that cannot be corrected by conventional means, such as refractive correction, medication, or surgery.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001007" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hirsutism</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormally increased hair growth referring to a male pattern of body hair (androgenic hair).</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Reduced density of hairs.

Comment:
This term applies if the number of hair shafts per unit area is reduced. The term fine hair is used to describe hair with a reduced diameter.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000294" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Low anterior hairline</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Distance between the hairline (trichion) and the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose), in the midline, more than two SD below the mean. Alternatively, an apparently decreased distance between the hairline and the glabella.

Comment:
This feature gives the appearance of a short forehead. It is distinct from hirsutism of the forehead. In the latter, orientation of hair growth is lateral and texture and density of hair differs from scalp hair.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000664" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Synophrys</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Meeting of the medial eyebrows in the midline.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000574" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Thick eyebrow</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Increased density/number and/or increased diameter of eyebrow hairs.

Comment:
Thickness can be regional (medial, middle/central, lateral) or total.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011231" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Prominent eyelashes</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Eyelashes that draw the attention of the viewer due to increased density and/or length and/or curl without meeting the criteria of trichomegaly.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Hyperplasia of the gingiva (FMA:59762, that is, a thickening of the soft tissue overlying the alveolar ridge. The degree of thickening ranges from involvement of the interdental papillae alone to gingival overgrowth covering the entire tooth crown.

Comment:
This finding is to be distinguished from overgrowth of the alveolar ridge.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000377" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the pinna</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of the pinna, which is also referred to as the auricle or external ear.

Comment:
The term &#39;dysplastic&#39; is no longer accepted as a descriptor for an ear with unusual morphology. Each specific anatomical component of the ear should be described when the ear is thought to be abnormal in appearance.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006610" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Wide intermamillary distance</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A larger than usual distance between the left and right nipple.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A deformity of the chest caused by overgrowth of the ribs and characterized by protrusion of the sternum.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000028" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cryptorchidism</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testis in inguinal canal. That is, absence of one or both testes from the scrotum owing to failure of the testis or testes to descend through the inguinal canal to the testis.

Comment:
The gonad is mobile and can be retracted superiorly by the cremaster muscle reflex stimulated, for instance, by cold or touch. A retracted testis is not cryptorchidism. An abdominal testis cannot be distinguished by physical examination from an (Apparently) absent testis and requires radiological (or, rarely, surgical) procedures for assessment.</p>
