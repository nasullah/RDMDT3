This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
- Mitochondrial DNA<br />
  - Common nuclear genetic causes as appropriate

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001197" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of prenatal development or birth</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the fetus or the birth of the fetus, excluding structural abnormalities.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Because of the close link between prenatal developmental abnormalities and abnormalities of the birth process, a single term is chosen to subsume both classes of abnormality.

	Diminished amniotic fluid volume in pregnancy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Oligohydramnios is the opposite of polyhydramnios. In normal pregnancy the amniotic fluid volume increases by about 10 ml/day until the 34th, after which it slowly diminishes. A normal amniotic fluid volume at term is about 500-2,000 ml. Oligohydramnios is defined as an AFI (amniotic fluid index) less than 5 cm or smallest vertical pocket of fluid less than 2 cm.

	An abnormality of the skin characterized the presence of excessive amounts of dry surface scales on the skin resulting from an abnormality of keratinization.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The ichthyoses are a group of skin diseases characterized by drying and scaling of skin with the accumulation of thick scales and cracks that may be painful or bleed. The abnormality in ichthyosis lies in am imbalance in the normal lifecycle of skin in which growth is matched with dying and shedding of skin cells. In ichthyosis, skin cells reproduce at a rate faster than dead skin cells can be shed or reproduce at a normal rate with a reduction in the rate of shedding. Either abnormality leads to a build up of dry and scaly skin. Note that this term refers to the morphological abnormality of the skin and not the disorder.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001903" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anemia</a></h3>
	A reduction in erythrocytes volume or hemoglobin concentration.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Anemia is not a specific entity but can result from many underlying pathologic processes. The three main causes of anemia are blood loss, decreased or faulty red blood cell production, and increased destruction of red blood cells. Various classifications are in clinical use including a classification according to the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the erythrocytes: microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic. Anemias can also be classified according to variations in cell size and shape, as reflected by the red-cell distribution width (RDW). Additionally, anemias can be classified into those of inadequate production and hemolytic anemias.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001924" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sideroblastic anemia</a></h3>
	Sideroblastic anemia results from a defect in the incorporation of iron into the heme molecule. A sideroblast is an erythroblast that has stainable deposits of iron in cytoplasm (this can be demonstrated by Prussian blue staining).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Sideroblastic anemia may be either congenital or acquired. In sideroblastic anemia, the hematocrit tends to be around 20 to 30 percent, and the mean corpuscular volume is normal or low.

Mild neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil cont between 1000 and 1500 cells per microliter, moderte as between 500 and 100, and severe as less than 500 cells.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001251" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ataxia</a></h3>
	Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- oder overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Ataxia can be differentiated into dyssynergy, asynergy, dysmetria (hypometria, hypermetria), dysdiadochokinesis, gait ataxia, truncal ataxia, limb ataxia, and dysarthria). Note: This term does not include sensory ataxia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001257" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Spasticity</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001324" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Muscle weakness</a></h3>
	Reduced strength of muscles.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
It is important clinical to distinguish between muscle weakness, fatigue, and asthenia. Fatigue describes the inability to continue performing a task after multiple repetitions; in contrast, a patient with primary weakness is unable to perform the first repetition of the task. Asthenia is a sense of weariness or exhaustion in the absence of muscle weakness. Conditions that result in intrinsic muscle weakness can be divided into several main categories: infectious, neurologic, endocrine, inflammatory, rheumatologic, genetic, metabolic, electrolyte-induced, or drug-induced.

	A condition caused by a deficiency of parathyroid hormone characterized by hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000843" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperparathyroidism</a></h3>
	Excessive production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by the parathyroid glands.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000846" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Adrenal insufficiency</a></h3>
	Insufficient production of steroid hormones (primarily cortisol) by the adrenal glands as a result of a primary defect in the glands themselves.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Adrenal insufficiency may cause persistent vomiting, anorexia, hypoglycemia, poor weight gain in a child, or unexplained weight loss in an adult, malaise, fatigue, muscular weakness, unexplained isotonic or hyponatremic dehydration, hyperkalemia, hypotension, hypoglycemia and especially generalized hyperpigmentation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004319" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypoaldosteronism</a></h3>
	Abnormally reduced levels of aldosterone.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Aldosterone is a hormone that is produce by the adrenal cortex and that acts on the distal tubules and collecting ducts to favor retention of sodium excretion of potassium, and increased water retention, thereby tending to increase blood pressure. Aldosterone is sometimes called a mineralocorticoid because of its influence on sodium homeostasis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000824" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Growth hormone deficiency</a></h3>
	Insufficient production of growth hormone, which is produced by the anterior pituitary gland. Growth hormone is a major participant in control of growth and metabolism.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The effects of growth hormone are mediated almost exclusively by insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF-1), which is produced primarily in the liver. Growth hormone deficiency refers to inadequate levels of GH (and therefore IGF-1), resulting in growth retardation in children and metabolic disturbances in adults.
