  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Repeated abnormal pattern on transferrin isolelectric focussing in a child of &gt;3 months, AND
•	Clinically multisystem disease with abnormal protein C and / or S; AND Factor VIII and/or factor XI and /or ATIII (abnormal)
OR
•	Muscle biopsy with abnormal dystroglycan pattern
OR
•	Normal transferrin isolelectric focussing but patient thought to have CDG after assessment by metabolic or neurometabolic specialist and exclusion of abnormalities of VLCFA or 7DHC</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Known genetic cause</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
•	Transferrin isoelectric focussing and, if abnormal, confirmed on a second sample and PMM2 deficiency excluded
•	Those with normal IEF should be assessed by metabolic or neurometabolic specialist for inclusion; 7DHC should be normal;  VLCFA should be normal; protein C and S, factor VIII and XI and ATIII, T4 and TSH should be measured;  for suspected isolated O glycosylation or combined N- and O-glycosylation defect ApoC III should be measured.</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

Comment:
Vacuolated lymphocytes occur most commonly as the peripheral blood manifestation of inherited metabolic disorders, including Niemann-Pick disease Type A, infantile sialic acid storage disorder, Wolman&#39;s disease, Mucolipidoses II and III, Salla disease, mannosidosis, Batten disease, GM1 gangliosidosis, neuraminidase deficiency, galactosidosis, fucosidosis, Pompe&#39;s disease, aspartylglycosaminuria and rarely, multiple sulfatase deficiency. The metabolic product, which causes vacuolation, depends on the specific enzyme deficiency.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.

Comment:
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002072" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Chorea</a></h3>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001251" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ataxia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- oder overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly).

Comment:
Ataxia can be differentiated into dyssynergy, asynergy, dysmetria (hypometria, hypermetria), dysdiadochokinesis, gait ataxia, truncal ataxia, limb ataxia, and dysarthria). Note: This term does not include sensory ataxia.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001257" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Spasticity</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes with increased muscle tone, exaggerated (hyperexcitable) tendon reflexes.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001332" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dystonia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormally increased muscular tone that causes fixed abnormal postures. There is a slow, intermittent twisting motion that leads to exaggerated turning and posture of the extremities and trunk.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001290" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Generalized hypotonia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Generalized muscular hypotonia (abnormally low muscle tone).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002415" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Leukodystrophy</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Leukodystrophy refers to deterioration of white matter of the brain resulting from degeneration of myelin sheaths in the CNS. Their basic defect is directly related to the synthesis and maintenance of myelin membranes.

Comment:
The deterioration coincides with clinical regression of skills, and in the most severe cases neurological devastation. Leukodystrophy should be distinguished from leukoencephalopathy (defect causing secondary myelin damage). Note that the term leukodystrophy is most often used to refer to a disease rather than a phenotypic feature, and a more precise description is to be preferred if possible.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002134" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the basal ganglia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormality of the basal ganglia.

Comment:
The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei (striatum, pallidum substantia nigra, and the subthalamic nucleus) at the base of the forebrain that are connected to the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, and other areas. The basal ganglia subserve motor functions that are distinct from those of the pyramidal (corticospinal) tract, for which reason neurologic abnormalities caused by lesions to the basal ganglia are often referred to as extrapyramidal.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007360" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the cerebellum</a></h3>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The presence of excess amniotic fluid in the uterus during pregnancy.

Comment:
Polyhydramnios is diagnosed if the deepest vertical pool of amniotic fluid is more than 8 cm or amniotic fluid index is more than 95th percentile for the corresponding gestational age.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001789" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hydrops fetalis</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The abnormal accumulation of fluid in two or more fetal compartments, including ascites, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and skin edema.

Comment:
The most common causes of hydrops fetalis are hematologic (inclusing isoimmunization because of Rhesus incompatibility and other causes), hereditary hemolytic disorders, fetal hemorrhage, disorders of red cell production), cardiovascular disorders, infections, certain intrathoracic malformations, and idiopathic forms.</p>
