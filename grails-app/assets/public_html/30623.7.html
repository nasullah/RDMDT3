  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- proband has clinical features diagnostic or resulting in an operational diagnosis
for Gorlin syndrome or Cowden syndrome OR
- proband has colorectal cancer (diagnosed age &lt;60) AND &gt;= 1 sebaceous adenoma, sebaceous carcinoma or epithelioma (histologically confirmed, diagnosed age &lt;60)

Unaffected individuals should not be recruited in this disorder. Recruitment should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing as below is strongly recommended PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT to allow appropriate management of families with readily detectable mutations in known disease genes:

- PTCH1 (Gorlin), PTEN (Cowden), MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 (Muir Torre)</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000256" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Macrocephaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Occipitofrontal (head) circumference greater than 97th centile compared to appropriate, age matched, sex-matched normal standards. Alternatively, a apparently increased size of the cranium.

Comment:
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far above the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Macrocephaly is an absolute term. The term relative macrocephaly can be used when the head size centile exceeds the centile for height, for example, head size at the 75th centile with height at the 5th centile for age and sex.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The presence of multiple lipomas (a type of benign tissue made of fatty tissue).

Comment:
A lipoma is a benign tumor composed of fatty tissue. They are the most common form of soft tissue tumor and are usually soft to the touch, movable, and generally painless (but there is a separate entity of painful multiple lipomas which is a hereditary disease called Dercum disease or adiposis dolorosa). Many lipomas are small (under one centimeter diameter) but can enlarge to sizes greater than six centimeters. Lipomas are commonly found in adults from 40 to 60 years of age, but can also be found in children.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030258" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperpigmented genitalia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Localized or generalized increased genital pigmentation.

Comment:
This is an assessment of the relative pigmentation of the genitalia compared to the overall pigmentation of the individual. Hyperpigmentation can affect other parts of the body or be restricted to the genitalia. Genital hyperpigmentation can be generalized or localized. Localized areas of hyperpigmentation of the glans of the penis are especially common. This should be differentiated from Freckled genitalia in which one or more small, focal areas of hyperpigmentation are present. Localized hyperpigmentation can be objectively determined due to the difference from the immediate surrounding tissue color, while generalized hyperpigmentation may be more difficult to determine and is therefore a subjective manifestation. If the finding is localized, the description should be appended with a description of the affected part(s).</p>
