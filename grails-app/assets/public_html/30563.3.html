						<!-- <h2>Autoimmune diabetes Eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Diabetes AND<br />
- ≥2 autoimmune disorders with ≥2 of these diagnosed <10 years.

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>


<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
- AIRE if Addison’s disease is present

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001520" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Large for gestational age</a></h3>
	The term large for gestational age applies to babies whose birth weight lies above the 90th percentile for that gestational age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Fetal macrosomia has been defined in several different ways, including birth weight of 4000-4500 g (8 lb 13 oz to 9 lb 15 oz) or greater than 90% for gestational age after correcting for neonatal sex and ethnicity. Based on these definitions, macrosomia affects 1-10% of all pregnancies. A diagnosis of fetal macrosomia can be made only by measuring birth weight after delivery; therefore, the condition is confirmed only retrospectively, ie, after delivery of the neonate.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001998" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neonatal hypoglycemia</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000956" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Acanthosis nigricans</a></h3>
	A dermatosis characterized by thickened, hyperpigmented plaques, typically on the intertriginous surfaces and neck.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Acanthosis nigricans is seen in a variety of syndromes including those characterized by insulin resistance or fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) mutations, and may also occur as an adverse effect of several medications that promote hyperinsulinemia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005562" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Multiple renal cysts</a></h3>
	The presence of many cysts in the kidney.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012210" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal renal morphology</a></h3>
	Any structural anomaly of the kidney.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000407" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sensorineural hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A type of hearing impairment  in one or both ears related to an abnormal functionality of the cochlear nerve.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss caused by damage or dysfunction of the auditory nerve (cranial nerve VIII, also known as the cochlear nerve).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001513" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Obesity</a></h3>
	Body weight that is grossly above the acceptable or desirable weight, usually due to accumulation of excess fats in the body. The standards may vary with age, sex, genetic or cultural background. In the body mass index (BMI), a BMI greater than 30.0 kg/m2 is considered obese, and a BMI greater than 40.0 kg/m2 is considered morbidly obese.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001956" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Truncal obesity</a></h3>
	Obesity located preferentially in the trunk of the body as opposed to the extremities.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009125" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Lipodystrophy</a></h3>
	Degenerative changes of the fat tissue.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009064" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Generalized lipodystrophy</a></h3>
	Generalized degenerative changes of the fat tissue.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003635" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue in limbs</a></h3>
	Loss (disappearance) of previously present subcutaneous fat tissue in arm or leg.
