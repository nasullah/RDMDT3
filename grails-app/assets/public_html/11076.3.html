<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Severe/ Profound; or if siblings affected or parental consanguinity, moderate or worse hearing loss<br />
- Congenital and/or prelingual<br />
- Bilateral<br />
- Apparently non-syndromic

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Proven or suspected congenital CMV infection<br />
- Post-meningitis<br />
- Auditory neuropathy with concomitant neonatal hypoxia, jaundice, or prematurity

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
- GJB2 (coding region plus splice site and GJB6 deletion)<br />
 - SLC26A4 if enlarged vestibular aqueducts

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	An abnormality of vibrational conductance of sound to the inner ear leading to impairment of sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
A conductive hearing impariment with greater than 90 dB loss.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004452" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the middle ear ossicles</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the middle-ear ossicles (three small bones called malleus, incus, and stapes) that are contained within the middle ear and serve to transmit sounds from the air to the fluid-filled labyrinth (cochlea).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000388" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Otitis media</a></h3>
	Inflammation or infection of the middle ear.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001751" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Vestibular dysfunction</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the functioning of the vestibular apparatus.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The vestibular apparatus is the nonauditory portion of the inner ear that mediates the subjective sensation of motion and spatial orientation of the head, adjusts muscular activity and body position to maintain posture, and stabilizes in space the fixation point of the eyes when the head moves, in order to provide a stable image upon the retina. The functioning of the vestibular system is often checked clinically by means of the caloric test, in which the head is tilted backward by about 60 degrees and either warm or cold water is introduced into the external auditory meatus on one side. The immediate results are usually vertigo, nausea, nystagmus, and twisting of the head and body.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000360" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Tinnitus</a></h3>
	Tinnitus is an auditory perception that can be described as the experience of sound, in the ear or in the head, in the absence of external acoustic stimulation.

<br />
Comment:<br />
The cochlea is an inner ear structure comprised of a snail-shell like structure divided into three fluid-filled parts. Two are canals for the transmission of pressure and in the third is the organ of Corti, which detects pressure impulses and responds with electrical impulses which travel along the auditory nerve to the brain.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011039" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the helix</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the helix. The helix is the outer rim of the ear that extends from the insertion of the ear on the scalp (root) to the termination of the cartilage at the earlobe.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009901" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Crumpled ear</a></h3>
	Distortion of the course of the normal folds of the ear and the appearance of supernumerary crura and folds.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cryptotia</a></h3>
	Invagination of the superior part of the auricle under a fold of temporal skin.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
There are associated anomalies of the upper antihelix and crura. The upper one-third of the auricle is primarily affected and there is an inferomedial displacement of the Helical Darwin tubercle. Two types are recognized. Type I: the antihelix and superior crus are reduced in size; type II: it is the antihelix and inferior crus that are affected.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000378" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cupped ear</a></h3>
	Laterally protruding ear that lacks antihelical folding (including absence of inferior and superior crura).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000400" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Macrotia</a></h3>
	Median longitudinal ear length greater than two standard deviations above the mean and median ear width greater than two standard deviations above the mean (objective); or, apparent increase in length and width of the pinna (subjective).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This is acknowledged to be a bundled term but retained here because of its usefulness in practice. Ear length is determined by the maximal distance from the superior aspect to the inferior aspect of the external ear. If only length is increased the term Long ear should be used.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008551" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microtia</a></h3>
	Underdevelopment of the external ear.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The definitions of microtia follow a widely used, surgically based, classification of ear anomalies outlined by Weerda 1988. As microtia indicates at least both decreased length and width, and in more severe forms it includes abnormal shape of structures, all forms are acknowledged to be bundled terms, but are retained here because they are well established.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009892" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anotia</a></h3>
	Complete absence of any auricular structures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100687" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Polyotia</a></h3>
	The presence of an extra auricle on one or both sides of the head.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000411" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Protruding ear</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000175" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft palate</a></h3>
	Cleft palate is a developmental defect of the palate resulting from a failure of fusion of the palatine processes and manifesting as a separation of the roof of the mouth (soft and hard palate).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Cleft palate is a developmental defect that occurs between the 7th and 12th week of pregnancy. Normally, the palatine processes fuse during this time to form the soft and hard palate. A failure of fusion results in a cleft palate. The clinical spectrum ranges from bifid uvula, to (incomplete or complete) cleft of the soft palate, up to (complete or incomplete) cleft of both the soft and hard palate.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000204" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft upper lip</a></h3>
	A gap in the upper lip. This is a congenital defect resulting from nonfusion of tissues of the lip during embryonal development.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000324" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Facial asymmetry</a></h3>
	An abnormal difference between the left and right sides of the face.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002006" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Facial cleft</a></h3>
	A congenital malformation with a cleft (gap or opening) in the face.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000625" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft eyelid</a></h3>
	A short discontinuity of the margin of the lower or upper eyelid.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The lateral segment of the lower eyelid is most commonly involved. As the milder forms of this finding are clearly subjective and no boundary of subjective and objective is defined, the term is considered subjective. The term eyelid coloboma has been replaced because the word coloboma should be used only for defects at the site of fusion of embryologic structures, which is not the case here. Modifiers to designate the location of the cleft may be added, such as lower and lateral.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000589" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Coloboma</a></h3>
	A developmental defect characterized by a cleft of some portion of the eye or ocular adnexa.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000347" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Micrognathia</a></h3>
	Developmental hypoplasia of the mandible.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Mandibular hypoplasia, also known as micrognathia, is a term that describes an abnormally small lower jaw.

<br />
Comment:<br />
This category is meant to comprise congenital (developmental) structural heart defects.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002023" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anal atresia</a></h3>
	Congenital absence of the anus, i.e., the opening at the bottom end of the intestinal tract.

	Abnormal narrowing of the anal opening.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000077" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the kidney</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the kidney.<br />
<br />

<br />
Comment:<br />
A vertebra is one of 33 bony segments that form the spinal column of humans. There are 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral and 4 coccygeal vertebrae (the coccygeal vertebrae are fused into one coccyx bone).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
	A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
