- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000957" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cafe-au-lait spot</a></h3>
	Cafe-au-lait spots are hyperpigmented lesions that can vary in color from light brown to dark brown with smooth borders and having a size of 1.5 cm or more in adults and 0.5 cm or more in children.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The phrase cafe-au-lait comes from the French word for milk-coffee. A single cafe-au-lait spot can be an isolated finding in otherwise normal individuals. Multiple cafe-au-lait spots often indicate the presence of neurofibromatosis type 1 but may also be seen in other diseases including McCune-Albright syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Fanconi anemia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009554" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Projection of scalp hair onto lateral cheek</a></h3>
	An tongue-like extension of hair towards the cheeks.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001482" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Subcutaneous nodule</a></h3>
	Slightly elevated lesions on or in the skin with a diameter of over 5 mm.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Subcutaneous nodules may move freely within the dermis or may be fixed to skin above or subcutaneous tissue below.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009719" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypomelanotic macules</a></h3>
	Hypomelanotic macules ("ash leaf spots") are white or lighter patches of skin that may appear anywhere on the body and are caused by a lack of melanin. White ash leaf-shaped macules are considered to be characteristic of tuberous sclerosis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000169" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Gingival fibromatosis</a></h3>
	The presence of fibrosis of the gingiva.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Gingival fibromatosis is characterized by a slowly progressive benign enlargement of the oral gingival tissues. Both genetic and pharmacologically induced forms of gingival fibromatosis are known. The most common genetic form, hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF), is usually transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait, although sporadic cases are common and autosomal recessive inheritance has been reported.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009724" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Subungual fibromas</a></h3>
	The presence of fibromata beneath finger or toenails.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009722" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dental enamel pits</a></h3>
	The presence of small depressions in the dental enamel.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009720" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Adenoma sebaceum</a></h3>
	The presence of a sebaceous adenoma with origin in the sebum secreting cells of the skin.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Facial angiofibromas, also known as adenoma sebaceum, are reddish papillary lesions (fibrous skin tumors) that are found around the nose, cheeks, and chin and considered to be characteristic of tuberous sclerosis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009721" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Shagreen patch</a></h3>
	A plaque representing a connective-tissue nevus. Connective tissue naevi are uncommon skin lesions that occur when the deeper layers of the skin do not develop correctly or the components of these layers occur in the wrong proportion. Shagreen patches are oval-shaped and nevoid, skin-colored or occasionally pigmented, smooth or crinkled, The word shagreen refers to a type of roughened untanned leather.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012469" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Infantile spasms</a></h3>
	Infantile spasms represent a subset of "epileptic spasms". Infantile Spasms are epileptic spasms starting in the first year of life (infancy).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002514" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebral calcification</a></h3>
	The presence of calcium deposition within brain structures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding can be demonstrated upon cerebral computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or potentially by standard radiography of the skull.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009716" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Subependymal nodules</a></h3>
	Small nodular masses which originate in the subependymal region of the lateral ventricles and protrude into the ventricular cavity. They may represent subependymal hamartomas of tuberous sclerosis or nodular heterotopia of grey matter.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009717" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cortical tubers</a></h3>
	Cortical tubers in the brain are hamartomatous lesions typically located at the gray-white matter interface, commonly in the frontal and parietal lobes. Cortical tubers are composed of abnormal glial and neural cells, and the size, number, and location vary among patients.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000717" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Autism</a></h3>
	Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. Autism begins in childhood. It is marked by the presence of markedly abnormal or impaired development in social interaction and communication and a markedly restricted repertoire of activity and interest. Manifestations of the disorder vary greatly depending on the developmental level and chronological age of the individual (DSM-IV).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term refers to the diagnosis of autism and is left for convenience. However, it is preferable to annotate the exact phenotypic abnormalities rather than merely the diagnostic category autism.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009592" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Astrocytoma</a></h3>
	Astrocytoma is a neoplasm of the central nervous system derived from astrocytes. Astrocytes are a type of glial cell, and thus astrocytoma is a subtype of glioma.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009734" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Optic glioma</a></h3>
	A glioma originating in the optic nerve or optic chiasm.

	Areas of the retina lacking pigmentation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001328" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Specific learning disability</a></h3>
	Impairment of certain skills such as reading or writing, coordination, self-control, or attention that interfere with the ability to learn. The impairment is not related to a global deficiency of intelligence.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term learning disability is used with different meanings in different contexts. Significant impairments of mental functioning with a reduction in IQ below 70 should be coded as mental retardation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002888" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ependymoma</a></h3>
	The presence of an ependymoma of the central nervous system.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
According to MPATH, ependymomas are neoplasms derived from the ependymal cells lining the ventricles and aqueduct of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord and may be malignant or benign.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007018" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000826" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Precocious puberty</a></h3>
	The onset of secondary sexual characteristics before a normal age. Although it is difficult to define normal age ranges because of the marked variation with which puberty begins in normal children, precocious puberty can be defined as the onset of puberty before the age of 8 years in girls or 9 years in boys.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001716" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012798" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pulmonary lymphangiomyomatosis</a></h3>
	Infiltration of smooth muscle-like cells in lymph vessels as well as the lung (pleura, alveolar septa, bronchi, pulmonary vessels and lymphatics as well as lymph nodes, especially in posterior mediastinum and retroperitoneum). Focal emphysema can develop because of airway narrowing, and the thoracic duct may be obliterated. Pulmonary lymphangiomyomatosis may lead to multiple small cysts with a hamartomatous proliferation of smooth muscle in their walls.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Pulmonary lymphangiomyomatosis is a manifestation of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, which may also affect extrapulmonary locations. It can be seen in tuberous sclerosis.

	A chordoma is a tumors that arises from embryonic remnants of the notochord along the length of the neuraxis. Chordomas generally occur in the sacrum, intracranially at the clivus, or along the spinal axis.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The notochord is a mesodermal embryonic structure that defines the primitive axis of the embryo and which survives in the adult vertebral column as the intervetebral disks.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004390" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hamartomatous polyps</a></h3>
