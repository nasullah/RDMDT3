  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">A. One or more of:  
- Renal hypodysplasia or agenesis  
- Congenital multicystic kidney  
- Congenital, persistent, severe hydroureter  
- Congenital, persistent, severe congenital hydronephrosis  
- Bladder exstrophy  
- Posterior urethral valves
In the presence or absence of family history or other features 
OR 
B. One or more of: 
- Duplex kidney 
- Vesicoureteric reflux 
- Vesicoureteric or ureteropelvic junction obstruction 
AND - Syndromic disease OR 
- Family history of CAKUT  
AND (for A. or B.) 
- Unaffected individuals have undergone appropriate investigation for cryptic disease e.g. renal ultrasound scan 
- Individuals with severe or syndromic disease should be recruited according to standard guidance, preferably as trios 
- In other cases, unaffected individuals should not be recruited. Recruitment in such families should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Clinical or molecular diagnosis of autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease
- Known causative genetic or chromosomal abnormality</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 - HNF1B if personal or family history of diabetes mellitus
  - SALL1 if 2 out of imperforate anus, ear abnormalities, thumb abnormalities</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

Congenital posterior urethral valve is a cause of bladder outlet obstruction in male newborns.

Comment:
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term &#39;psychomotor retardation&#39; is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.

Comment:
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.</p>

Comment:
During embryonic development the major head and neck structures are formed from the five pharyngeal arches (bands of tissue). Incomplete, failed or persistent embryonic development of these arches results in several anomalies or defects in the neck.</p>
