The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
- OPA1 if VEP prolonged

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000407" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sensorineural hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A type of hearing impairment  in one or both ears related to an abnormal functionality of the cochlear nerve.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss caused by damage or dysfunction of the auditory nerve (cranial nerve VIII, also known as the cochlear nerve).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005101" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">High-frequency hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A type of hearing impairment affecting primarily the higher frequencies of sound (3,000 to 6,000 Hz).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
High frequency hearing impairment often involves loss of ability to hear consonants such as s, f, t, and z, even though vowels can be heard normally.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012781" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Mid-frequency hearing loss</a></h3>
	A type of hearing impairment affecting primarily the middle frequencies of sound (1000 Hz to 3000 Hz).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008542" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Low-frequency hearing loss</a></h3>
	A type of hearing impairment affecting primarily the low frequencies of sound (125 Hz to 1000 Hz).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000405" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Conductive hearing impairment</a></h3>
	An abnormality of vibrational conductance of sound to the inner ear leading to impairment of sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
A conductive hearing impariment with greater than 90 dB loss.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004452" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the middle ear ossicles</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the middle-ear ossicles (three small bones called malleus, incus, and stapes) that are contained within the middle ear and serve to transmit sounds from the air to the fluid-filled labyrinth (cochlea).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000388" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Otitis media</a></h3>
	Inflammation or infection of the middle ear.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001751" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Vestibular dysfunction</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the functioning of the vestibular apparatus.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The vestibular apparatus is the nonauditory portion of the inner ear that mediates the subjective sensation of motion and spatial orientation of the head, adjusts muscular activity and body position to maintain posture, and stabilizes in space the fixation point of the eyes when the head moves, in order to provide a stable image upon the retina. The functioning of the vestibular system is often checked clinically by means of the caloric test, in which the head is tilted backward by about 60 degrees and either warm or cold water is introduced into the external auditory meatus on one side. The immediate results are usually vertigo, nausea, nystagmus, and twisting of the head and body.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000360" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Tinnitus</a></h3>
	Tinnitus is an auditory perception that can be described as the experience of sound, in the ear or in the head, in the absence of external acoustic stimulation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001963" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal speech discrimination</a></h3>
	A type of hearing impairment prominently characterized by a difficulty in understanding speech, rather than an inability to hear speech. Poor speech discrimination is a very common symptom of high frequency hearing loss.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010780" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperacusis</a></h3>
	Over-sensitivity to certain frequency ranges of sound.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000375" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of cochlea</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the cochlea.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The cochlea is an inner ear structure comprised of a snail-shell like structure divided into three fluid-filled parts. Two are canals for the transmission of pressure and in the third is the organ of Corti, which detects pressure impulses and responds with electrical impulses which travel along the auditory nerve to the brain.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011376" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Morphological abnormality of the vestibule of the inner ear</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009738" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the antihelix</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the antihelix.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
An abnormal form of the antihelix, which is the curved prominence of cartilage, parallel with and in front of the helix, and which divides into the crura antihelicis, between which is a triangular depression, the fossa triangularis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011039" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the helix</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the helix. The helix is the outer rim of the ear that extends from the insertion of the ear on the scalp (root) to the termination of the cartilage at the earlobe.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009901" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Crumpled ear</a></h3>
	Distortion of the course of the normal folds of the ear and the appearance of supernumerary crura and folds.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This is distinct from Stahl ear and Shell ear, with which the term has sometimes been conflated. The appearance often changes markedly after birth.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cryptotia</a></h3>
	Invagination of the superior part of the auricle under a fold of temporal skin.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
There are associated anomalies of the upper antihelix and crura. The upper one-third of the auricle is primarily affected and there is an inferomedial displacement of the Helical Darwin tubercle. Two types are recognized. Type I: the antihelix and superior crus are reduced in size; type II: it is the antihelix and inferior crus that are affected.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000378" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cupped ear</a></h3>
	Laterally protruding ear that lacks antihelical folding (including absence of inferior and superior crura).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000400" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Macrotia</a></h3>
	Median longitudinal ear length greater than two standard deviations above the mean and median ear width greater than two standard deviations above the mean (objective); or, apparent increase in length and width of the pinna (subjective).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This is acknowledged to be a bundled term but retained here because of its usefulness in practice. Ear length is determined by the maximal distance from the superior aspect to the inferior aspect of the external ear. If only length is increased the term Long ear should be used.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008551" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microtia</a></h3>
	Underdevelopment of the external ear.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The definitions of microtia follow a widely used, surgically based, classification of ear anomalies outlined by Weerda 1988. As microtia indicates at least both decreased length and width, and in more severe forms it includes abnormal shape of structures, all forms are acknowledged to be bundled terms, but are retained here because they are well established.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009892" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anotia</a></h3>
	Complete absence of any auricular structures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Complete absence of the auricle (external ear). The skin of the cheek passes smoothly over the aural area without definite elevation or depression.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100687" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Polyotia</a></h3>
	The presence of an extra auricle on one or both sides of the head.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000411" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Protruding ear</a></h3>
	Angle formed by the plane of the ear and the mastoid bone greater than the 97th centile for age (objective); or, outer edge of the helix more than 2 cm from the mastoid at the point of maximum distance (objective).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005103" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Calcification of the auricular cartilage</a></h3>
