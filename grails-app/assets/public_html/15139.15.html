  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Episodic flaccid paralysis or weakness and/or myotonia
- May develop progressive, usually proximal, weakness
- Electrophysiology including long and short exercise testing
- Intra-attack potassium documented whenever possible
- Normal renal function and thyroid function</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Primary renal or endocrine problem that may be causative
- Associated loss of consciousness with attacks</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 - Myotonia: DMPK, CNBP, SCN4A, CLCN1 (including MLPA)
 - Episodic weakness: CACNA1S, SCN4A, KCNJ2</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

Comment:
It is important clinical to distinguish between muscle weakness, fatigue, and asthenia. Fatigue describes the inability to continue performing a task after multiple repetitions; in contrast, a patient with primary weakness is unable to perform the first repetition of the task. Asthenia is a sense of weariness or exhaustion in the absence of muscle weakness. Conditions that result in intrinsic muscle weakness can be divided into several main categories: infectious, neurologic, endocrine, inflammatory, rheumatologic, genetic, metabolic, electrolyte-induced, or drug-induced.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An involuntary and painless delay in the relaxation of skeletal muscle following contraction or electrical stimulation.

Comment:
Patients often describe myotonia as stiffness that is worse at the onset of activity and that improves with repeated muscle contractions. Myotonia tends to worsen in cold weather. Myotonia can be elicited by voluntary muscle contraction of by muscle percussion (e.g., by tapping the thenar eminence). During physical examination, myotonia may be elicited by asking the patient to make a tight fist and then quickly open the hand. Myotonia is caused by an abnormality in the muscle membrane, i.e., of the ion channels that control the contraction of muscle fibers.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A type of migraine in which there is an aura characterized by focal neurological phenomena that usually proceed, but may accompany or occur in the absence of, the headache. The symptoms of an aura may include fully reversible visual, sensory, and speech symptoms but not motor weakness. Visual symptoms may include flickering lights, spots and lines and/or loss of vision and/or unilateral sensory symptoms such as paresthesias or numbness. At least one of the symptoms of an aura develops gradually over 5 or more minutes and/or different symptoms occur in succession.</p>

Headache attacks are commonly accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia.

Comment:
The definition of this term is based on the definition in the International Classification of Headache Disorders by the International Headache Society (pmid:15304572), which additionally stipulate that such headaches must have occurred at least five times and not other secondary cause must be apparent in order to make the diagnosis.</p>

Comment:
This term now covers many of the historical inexact descriptions such as Bird-like facies that probably should be avoided in modern genetics. This portion of the Ontology should be revised.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001315" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Reduced tendon reflexes</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Diminution of tendon reflexes, which is an invariable sign of peripheral nerve disease.

Comment:
The deep tendon reflex is a monosynaptic reflex arc with sensory and motor nerve components, but the arc is much more vulnerable to sensory nerve damage. Ankle plantar flexion is retained in all but the most severe peripheral neuropathies, and thus loss of the Achilles tendon reflex in an objective indication of a substantial sensory nerve defect.</p>

The strectch reflexes (also called deep tendon relfexes) include the knee-jerk reflex (patellar reflex, the biceps reflex, the triceps reflex, and the ankle jerk reflex or Achilles tendon reflex).</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The term gait disturbance can refer to any disruption of the ability to walk. In general, this can refer to neurological diseases but also fractures or other sources of pain that is triggered upon walking. However, in the current context gait disturbance refers to difficulty walking on the basis of a neurological or muscular disease.

Comment:
If possible, this term should not be used for new annotations. Rather, a more specific term should be sought.</p>
