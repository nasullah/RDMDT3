<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Patients with typical facial lentigines and/or XP-like pattern of photosensitivity<br />
- XP has been excluded based on normal unscheduled DNA synthesis and no mutations identified in any of the known XP genes.

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>


<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004334" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dermal atrophy</a></h3>
	Partial or complete wasting (atrophy) of the skin.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000953" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperpigmentation of the skin</a></h3>
	A darkening of the skin related to an increase in melanin production and deposition.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001010" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypopigmentation of the skin</a></h3>
	A reduction of skin color related to a decrease in melanin production and deposition.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012056" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cutaneous melanoma</a></h3>
	The presence of a melanoma of the skin.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The phenotypic presentation of melanomas is often described using the ABCDE mnemomic: A) Asymmetry; B) Borders of the lesion are irregular; C) Color changes from one area of the lesion to another, with shades of tan, brown, or black, and sometimes white, red, or blue; D) Diameter of the lesionis usually larger than 6 mm; E) Evolution of the appearance of the lesion with time. These rules do not, however, apply to every melanoma.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006739" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin</a></h3>
	Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is a malignant tumor of squamous epithelium.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007587" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Numerous pigmented freckles</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002671" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Basal cell carcinoma</a></h3>
	The presence of a basal cell carcinoma of the skin.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
A basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer which rarely metastasizes, but is still considered malignant because it can cause significant destruction and disfigurement by invading surrounding tissues. In 80 percent of all cases, basal cell cancers are found on the head and neck or on other sun-exposed areas of the body. Apart from sporadic basal cell carcinoma, there are hereditary conditions such as the basal cell nevus syndrome where patients develop multiple basal cell carcinomas throughout life.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002861" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Melanoma</a></h3>
	The presence of a melanoma, a malignant cancer originating from pigment producing melanocytes. Melanoma can originate from the skin or the pigmented layers of the eye (the uvea).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
A malignant skin tumor of originating from melanocytes, pigment cells normally present in the epidermis and sometimes in the dermis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001480" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Freckling</a></h3>
	The presence of an increased number of freckles, small circular spots on the skin that are darker than the surrounding skin because of deposits of melanin.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000992" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cutaneous photosensitivity</a></h3>
	An increased sensitivity of the skin to light. Photosensitivity may result in a rash upon exposure to the sun (which is known as photodermatosis). Photosensitivity can be diagnosed by phototests in which light is shone on small areas of skin.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008069" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neoplasm of the skin</a></h3>
	A tumor (abnormal growth of tissue) of the skin.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001029" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Poikiloderma</a></h3>
	Poikiloderma refers to a patch of skin with (1) reticulated hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation, (2) wrinkling secondary to epidermal atrophy, and (3) telangiectasias.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Poikiloderma does not refer to a specific disease entity, but can be seen owing to a number of different causes.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000656" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ectropion</a></h3>
	An outward turning (eversion) or rotation of the eyelid margin.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Ectropion is frequently associated wit overexposure of the palpebral and scleral conjunctiva and cornea. It usually involves the lower eyelid.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000490" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Deeply set eye</a></h3>
	An eye that is more deeply recessed into the plane of the face than is typical.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding should be distinguished from a prominent supraorbital ridge or inferior orbital margin. In Deeply set eyes, the globe is recessed in comparison to the overall prominence of the face. There is no known objective measurement, and diagnosing this feature depends heavily on the experience of the observer.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000648" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Optic atrophy</a></h3>
	Atrophy of the optic nerve. Optic atrophy results from the death of the retinal ganglion cell axons that comprise the optic nerve and manifesting as a pale optic nerve on fundoscopy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The diagnosis of optic atrophy is made when the optic disc loses its normal orange-pink color. Optic atrophy is an end stage that arises from myriad causes of optic nerve damage anywhere along the path from the retina to the lateral geniculate. Some of the most common etiologies are advanced glaucoma, optic neuritis, arteritic or non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy or a compressive lesion.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000509" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Conjunctivitis</a></h3>
	Inflammation of the  conjunctiva.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000491" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Keratitis</a></h3>
	Inflammation of the cornea.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000483" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Astigmatism</a></h3>
	Astigmatism describes a refractive error  characterized by a difference in the horizontal and vertical  curvature of the cornea.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The irregular curvature associated with astigmatism means that the optical system is not symmetric about the optical axis. Most commonly the cornea is affected such that the refractive power in one meridian is less than that of the perpendicular axis. Astigmatism of significant degree causes blurry vision.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000568" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microphthalmos</a></h3>
	A developmental anomaly characterized by abnormal smallness of one or both eyes.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000613" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Photophobia</a></h3>
	Excessive sensitivity to light with the sensation of discomfort or pain in the eyes due to exposure to bright light.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that the term photodysphoria is used to describe extreme photophobia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000621" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Entropion</a></h3>
	An inward turning (inversion) of the eyelid margin.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The inward turned eyelid margin increases the potential for mechanical irritation of the eye by eyelashes. Entropion is to be distinguished from epiblepharon.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001257" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Spasticity</a></h3>
	A motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes with increased muscle tone, exaggerated (hyperexcitable) tendon reflexes.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000726" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dementia</a></h3>
	A loss of global cognitive ability of sufficient amount to interfere with normal social or occupational function. Dementia represents a loss of previously present cognitive abilities, generally in adults, and can affect memory, thinking, language, judgment, and behavior.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002135" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Basal ganglia calcification</a></h3>
	The presence of calcium deposition affecting one or more structures of the basal ganglia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000639" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nystagmus</a></h3>
	Rhythmic, involuntary oscillations of one or both eyes related to abnormality in fixation, conjugate gaze, or vestibular mechanisms.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012444" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Brain atrophy</a></h3>
	Partial or complete wasting (loss) of brain tissue that was once present.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001337" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Tremor</a></h3>
	An unintentional, oscillating to-and-fro muscle movement.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Tremor is differentiated from other involuntary movement disorders, such as chorea, athetosis, ballism, tics, and myoclonus, by its repetitive, stereotyped movements of a regular amplitude and frequency. Clonus, unlike tremor, represents a rhythmic movement, which is increased by muscle stretching.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001268" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Mental deterioration</a></h3>
	Loss of previously present mental abilities, generally in adults.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001265" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyporeflexia</a></h3>
	Reduction of neurologic reflexes such as the knee-jerk reaction.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011400" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal CNS myelination</a></h3>
	An abnormality of myelination of nerves in the central nervous system.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
MERGED COMMENT:<br />
TARGET COMMENT: In the CNS, myelin is the product of oligodendrocytes (and not of Schwann cells, as in the PNS).<br />
--------------------<br />
SOURCE COMMENT: An abnormality of the process in which myelin sheaths are formed and maintained around neurons or the result of such an abnormality.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001272" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebellar atrophy</a></h3>
	Atrophy (wasting) of the cerebellum.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Cerebellar atrophy can be diagnosed if the cerebellum is small with shrunken folia and large cerebellar fissures or if it has been shown to undergo progressive volume loss.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001347" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperreflexia</a></h3>
	Hyperreflexia is the presence of hyperactive stretch reflexes of the muscles.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Reflexes are graded according to the following scale: 0=absent; 1=present but diminished; 2=normoactive; 3=exaggerated; and 4=clonus. Clonus is always abnormal, and a grade 3 reflex may be abnormal if it is asymmetric or if it was previously grade 2 or less.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009830" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Peripheral neuropathy</a></h3>
	Peripheral neuropathy is a general term for any disorder of the peripheral nervous system. The main clinical features used to classify peripheral neuropathy are distribution, type (mainly demyelinating versus mainly axonal), duration, and course.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000135" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypogonadism</a></h3>
	A decreased functionality of the gonad.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Reduced functioning of the gonads (ovaries or testes) with reduced production of sex hormones.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001371" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Flexion contracture</a></h3>
	A flexion contracture is a bent (flexed) joint that cannot be straightened actively or passively. It is thus a chronic loss of joint motion due to structural changes in muscle, tendons, ligaments, or skin that prevents normal movement of joints.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004325" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Decreased body weight</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005328" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Progeroid facial appearance</a></h3>
	A degree of wrinkling of the facial skin that is more than expected for the age of the individual, leading to a prematurely aged appearance.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003224" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Increased cellular sensitivity to UV light</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003079" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Defective DNA repair after ultraviolet radiation damage</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000762" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Decreased nerve conduction velocity</a></h3>
	A reduction in the speed at which electrical signals propagate along the axon of a neuron.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Nerve conduction velocity is usually measured with surface electrodes placed on the skin over nerves at various locations. Following stimulation at one electrode, the speed at which the signal is propagated to other electrodes is recorded. Abnormal values may suggest demyelination, a conduction block, or axonopathy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001009" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Telangiectasia</a></h3>
	Telangiectasias refer to small dilated blood vessels located near the surface of the skin or mucous membranes, measuring between 0.5 and 1 millimeter in diameter. Telangiectasia are located especially on the tongue, lips, palate, fingers, face, conjunctiva, trunk, nail beds, and fingertips.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cataract</a></h3>
	A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
	Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002119" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ventriculomegaly</a></h3>
	An increase in size of the ventricular system of the brain.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001251" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ataxia</a></h3>
	Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- oder overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Ataxia can be differentiated into dyssynergy, asynergy, dysmetria (hypometria, hypermetria), dysdiadochokinesis, gait ataxia, truncal ataxia, limb ataxia, and dysarthria). Note: This term does not include sensory ataxia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002650" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Scoliosis</a></h3>
	The presence of an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000407" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sensorineural hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A type of hearing impairment  in one or both ears related to an abnormal functionality of the cochlear nerve.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss caused by damage or dysfunction of the auditory nerve (cranial nerve VIII, also known as the cochlear nerve).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004322" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short stature</a></h3>
	A height below that which is expected according to age and gender norms. Although there is no universally accepted definition of short stature, many refer to "short stature" as height more than 2 standard deviations below the mean for age and gender (or below the 3rd percentile for age and gender dependent norms).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002664" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neoplasm</a></h3>
	An organ or organ-system abnormality that consists of uncontrolled autonomous cell-proliferation which can occur in any part of the body as a benign or malignant neoplasm (tumour).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies neoplasms into four main groups: (i) benign neoplasm, (ii) in situ neoplasm, (iii) malignant neoplasm, and (iv) neoplasm of uncertain or unknown behavior. A malignant neoplasm is also known as cancer.
