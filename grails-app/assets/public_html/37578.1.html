<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Haemangioma on the scalp or face of >5cm, AND at least 1 major or 2 minor criteria:<br />
•	MAJOR: Anomaly of major cerebral arteries; Posterior fossa anomaly; Aortic arch anomaly; Ocular posterior segment anomaly; sternal defect<br />
•	MINOR:  Persistent embryonic artery other than trigeminal artery; Enhancing extra-axial lesion with features consistent with intracranial haemangioma or midline anomaly or neuronal migration defect; Ventricular septal defect or right aortic arch; Ocular anterior segment anomaly; Hypopituitarism/ectopic thyroid

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Clinical features suggestive of Sturge-Weber syndrome

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
- aCGH or equivalent

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000329" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Facial hemangioma</a></h3>
	Hemangioma, a benign tumor of the vascular endothelial cells, occurring in the face.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009145" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of cerebral artery</a></h3>
	An anomaly of a cerebral artery. The cerebral arteries comprise three main pairs of arteries and their branches, which supply the cerebrum of the brain. These are the anterior cerebral artery, the middle cerebral artery, and the posterior cerebral artery.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001305" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dandy-Walker malformation</a></h3>
	A congenital brain malformation typically characterized by incomplete formation of the cerebellar vermis, dilation of the fourth ventricle, and enlargement of the posterior fossa. In layman's terms, Dandy Walker malformation is a cyst in the cerebellum (typically symmetrical) that is involved with the fourth ventricle. This may interfere with the ability to drain cerebrospinal fluid from the brain, resulting in hydrocephalus. Dandy Walker cysts are formed during early embryonic development, while the brain forms. The cyst in the cerebellum typically has several blood vessels running through it connecting to the brain, thereby prohibiting surgical removal.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001321" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebellar hypoplasia</a></h3>
	Underdevelopment of the cerebellum.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
By prenatal ultrasound, cerebellar hypoplasia is diagnosed if the cerebellum measures more than two standard deviations below the mean. In adults, cerebellar hypoplasia is typically diagnosed by computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebellar hypoplasia can be diagnosed if there is a small cerebellum with fissures of normal size compared with the folia (this is a distinguishing characteristic compared with cerebellar atrophy).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007033" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebellar dysplasia</a></h3>
	The presence of developmental dysplasia of the cerebellum.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001680" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Coarctation of aorta</a></h3>
	Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing or constriction of a segment of the aorta.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Coarctation refers to a narrowing of the lumen of a vessel producing an obstruction to flow. Coarctation can occur in any region of the aorta.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012727" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Thoracic aortic aneurysm</a></h3>
	A bulging, weakened area in the wall of the thoracic aorta.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010775" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Vascular ring</a></h3>
	A developmental defect of the aortic arch system in which the trachea and esophagus are completely encircled by connected segments of the aortic arch and its branches. This occurs if the normal process of regression and persistence of the bilateral embryonic aortic arches fails.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004329" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the posterior segment of the eye</a></h3>
	The posterior segment comprises the anterior hyaloid membrane and all of the optical structures behind it: the vitreous humor, retina, choroid, and optic nerve.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007968" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous</a></h3>
	A failure of regression of the hyaloid vessel, which supplies the primary vitreous during embryogenesis and normally regresses in the third trimester of pregnancy, leading to a particular form of posterior cataract. This condition is known as Persistent Hyperplastic Primary Vitreous (PHPV).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008046" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the retinal vasculature</a></h3>
	An arterial or venous retinal vascular anomaly.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000609" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Optic nerve hypoplasia</a></h3>
	Underdevelopment of the optic nerve.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000589" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Coloboma</a></h3>
	A developmental defect characterized by a cleft of some portion of the eye or ocular adnexa.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004328" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the anterior segment of the eye</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the anterior segment of the eye.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The anterior segment comprises the structures in front of the vitreous humour: the cornea, iris, ciliary body, and lens.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cataract</a></h3>
	A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000647" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sclerocornea</a></h3>
	A congenital anomaly in which a part or the whole of the cornea acquires the characteristics of sclera, resulting in clouding of the cornea.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000766" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the sternum</a></h3>
	An anomaly of the sternum, also known as the breastbone.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010309" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Bifid sternum</a></h3>
	The sternal cleft is a rare congenital anomaly resulting from a fusion failure of the sternum.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Various degrees of bifid sternum may occur, varying from an enlarged suprasternal notch to complete separation of the two halves of the sternum. Ectopia cordis may or may not accompany this defect in its more severe form.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0040075" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypopituitarism</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100028" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ectopic thyroid</a></h3>
	Mislocalised thyroid gland.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
An aberrant or ectopic thyroid gland may occur anywhere along the path of initial descent of the thyroid. A total failure to descend contrasts with the incomplete descent of the thyroid, in which case the resulting final resting point of the gland may be high in the neck or just below the hyoid bone. Appart from an abnormal descent, accessory thyroid tissue can also occur, arising from remnants of the thyroglossal duct anywhere along the path of the thyroglossal duct tract.
