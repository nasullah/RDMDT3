  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Congenital Hypothyroidism defined biochemically as: 
Primary CH: neonatal or early onset elevated TSH with subnormal or normal thyroid hormone levels
Central CH: neonatal or early onset subnormal thyroid hormone levels with normal or subnormal TSH 

Preferred inclusion criteria – cases from multicase families or consanguineous backgrounds or (in primary CH) with additional extra-thyroidal features.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">A high likelihood that the phenotype is completely explained by an acquired aetiology (eg autoimmunity, maternal autoantibodies, iodine deficiency)
A pathogenic mutation in a known causative gene which completely explains the phenotype.</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice: 
Consideration of FOXE1, GNAS, SLC26A4, TSHR, TPO, DUOX2, TG</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A type of hypothyroidism that results from a defect in thyrotropin-releasing hormone activity.

Comment:
The simultaneous occurrence a low thyroid hormone level and a normal or low serum level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in a patient with hypothyroidism establishes the diagnosis of secondary hypothyroidism. The administration of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), which is normally synthesized and released by the hypothalamus, enables the physician to distinguish between pituitary and hypothalamic causes of hypothyroidism.
TRH will normally cause the release of TSH from the pituitary gland. When the hypothalamus does not synthesize or release TRH, the administration of exogenous TRH will result in prompt rise of serum TSH. To date, the cases reported of pituitary hypothyroidism. Hypothalamic hypothyroidism, on the other hand, may either be idiopathic or result from demonstrable hypothalamic disease.</p>

Comment:
An aberrant or ectopic thyroid gland may occur anywhere along the path of initial descent of the thyroid. A total failure to descend contrasts with the incomplete descent of the thyroid, in which case the resulting final resting point of the gland may be high in the neck or just below the hyoid bone. Appart from an abnormal descent, accessory thyroid tissue can also occur, arising from remnants of the thyroglossal duct anywhere along the path of the thyroglossal duct tract.</p>
