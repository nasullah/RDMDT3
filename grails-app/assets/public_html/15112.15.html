  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Progressive motor syndrome with parkinsonism (bradykinesia with one of tremor, gait disorder, stiffness)  
- Additional features may include spasticity, gaze palsy, early dementia, early bulbar failure, dyspraxia, ataxia, postural hypotension, cortical sensory loss, brain iron accumulation on MRI brain 
- Age at onset &lt;= 45 years or later onset with family history of similar condition in other family members  

Individuals with severe or syndromic disease should be recruited according to standard guidance, typically as trios. Disease status of apparently unaffected participants should be determined according to standard clinical practice to detect cryptic disease.  In other cases, unaffected individuals should not be recruited. Recruitment in such families should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Underlying cause not identified, e.g. structural brain lesion, Wilson disease</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 - C9ORF72, GRN, MAPT in cases with a clinical presentation suggestive of cortico-basal/PSP syndrome</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

Comment:
The diagnosis of optic atrophy is made when the optic disc loses its normal orange-pink color. Optic atrophy is an end stage that arises from myriad causes of optic nerve damage anywhere along the path from the retina to the lateral geniculate. Some of the most common etiologies are advanced glaucoma, optic neuritis, arteritic or non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy or a compressive lesion.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An inability to perceive odors. This is a general term describing inability to smell arising in any part of the process of smelling from absorption of odorants into the nasal mucous overlying the olfactory epithelium, diffusion to the cilia, binding to olfactory receptor sites, generation of action potentials in olfactory neurons, and perception of a smell.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002494" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormality of REM sleep. Phases of REM sleep are characterized by desynchronized EEG patterns, increases in heart rate and blood pressure, sympathetic activation, and a profound loss of muscle tonus except for the eye and middle-ear muscles.

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002495" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired vibratory sensation</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A decrease in the ability to perceive vibration. Clinically, this is usually tested with a tuning fork which vibrates at 128 Hz and is applied to bony prominences such as the malleoli at the ankles or the metacarpal-phalangeal joints. There is a slow decay of vibration from the tuning fork. The degree of vibratory sense loss can be crudely estimated by counting the number of seconds that the examiner can perceive the vibration longer than the patient.

Comment:
Impaired vibratory sensation may suggesti involvement of the posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway, which is responsible for transmitting fine touch, vibration and conscious proprioceptive information from the body to the cerebral cortex.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010830" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired tactile sensation</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A reduced sense of touch (tactile sensation). This is usually tested with a wisp of cotton or a fine camel&#39;s hair brush, by asking patients to say &#39;now&#39; each time they feel the stimulus.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010831" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired proprioception</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A loss or impairment of the sensation of the relative position of parts of the body and joint position.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010829" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired temperature sensation</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A reduced ability to discriminate between different temperatures.

Comment:
Temperature sensation can be tested by touching the skin several seconds with a water flask filled to the desired temperature. Persons with normal temperature sensation should at least be able to identify as warm a flask that is 35-36 degrees C and identify as cool a flask at 28-32 degrees C.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007328" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired pain sensation</a></h3>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007002" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Motor axonal neuropathy</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Progressive impairment of function of motor axons with muscle weakness, atrophy, and cramps. The deficits are length-dependent, meaning that muscles innervated by the longest nerves are affected first, so that for instance the arms are affected at a later age than the onset of deficits involving the lower leg.

Comment:
Distal motor neuropathy is a bundled term that should not be used if more detailed information about the phenotype is available.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002134" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the basal ganglia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormality of the basal ganglia.

Comment:
The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei (striatum, pallidum substantia nigra, and the subthalamic nucleus) at the base of the forebrain that are connected to the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, and other areas. The basal ganglia subserve motor functions that are distinct from those of the pyramidal (corticospinal) tract, for which reason neurologic abnormalities caused by lesions to the basal ganglia are often referred to as extrapyramidal.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Atrophy (wasting, decrease in size of cells or tissue) affecting the cerebrum.

Comment:
Atrophy may be progressive over time.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001272" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebellar atrophy</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Atrophy (wasting) of the cerebellum.

Comment:
Cerebellar atrophy can be diagnosed if the cerebellum is small with shrunken folia and large cerebellar fissures or if it has been shown to undergo progressive volume loss.</p>
