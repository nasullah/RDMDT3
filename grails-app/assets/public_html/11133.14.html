						<!-- <h2>Neuro-endocrine Tumours- PCC and PGL eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
- proband is affected by PCC/PGL (age <60) AND  ? 1 family member (FDR, SDR, TDR) affected by PCC/PGL (any age) AND sample available from  ? 1 affected family member OR<br />
- proband is affected by multiple PCC/PGL (first diagnosis age <60)<br />
<br />
Unaffected individuals should not be recruited in this disorder. Recruitment should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs.

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>


<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
Testing as below is strongly recommended PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT to allow appropriate management of families with readily detectable mutations in known disease genes:<br />
 - SDHB, SDHD, RET, VHL, SDHC, SDHAF2, MAX and TMEM127

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing as below is strongly recommended PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT to allow appropriate management of families with readily detectable mutations in known disease genes:<br />
 - SDHB, SDHD, RET, VHL, SDHC, SDHAF2, MAX and TMEM127

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002666" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pheochromocytoma</a></h3>
	Pheochromocytomas (also known as chromaffin tumors) produce, store, and secrete catecholamines. Pheochromocytomas usually originate from the adrenal medulla but may also develop from chromaffin cells in or about sympathetic ganglia. A common symptom of pheochromocytoma is hypertension owing to release of catecholamines.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002668" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Paraganglioma</a></h3>
	A carotid body tumor (also called paraganglionoma or chemodectoma) is a tumor found in the upper neck at the branching of the carotid artery. They arise from the chemoreceptor organ (paraganglion) located in the adventitia of the carotid artery bifurcation.
