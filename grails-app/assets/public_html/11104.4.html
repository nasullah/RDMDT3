	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001270" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Motor delay</a></h3>
	A type of Developmental delay characterized by a delay in acquiring motor skills.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000750" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Delayed speech and language development</a></h3>
	A degree of language development that is significantly below the norm for a child of a specified age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Language delay can be characterized by a failure to meet the developmental milestones for language development, an inability to follow directions, or slow or incomprehensible speech after the age of three years, as well as with severe problems with syntax or articulation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000508" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ptosis</a></h3>
	The upper eyelid margin is positioned 3 mm or more lower than usual and covers the superior portion of the iris (objective); or, the upper lid margin obscures at least part of the pupil (subjective).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000501" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Glaucoma</a></h3>
	Glaucoma refers loss of retinal ganglion cells in a characteristic pattern of optic neuropathy usually associated with increased intraocular pressure.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The feature that differentiates glaucoma from other causes of visual morbidity is a characteristic pattern of damage to the optic nerve head. This is most easily recognised at the superior and inferior poles of the optic disc. The vertical cup:disc ratio (VCDR) has proved to be a simple, relatively robust index of glaucomatous loss of the neuroretinal rim. As with intraocular pressure, VCDR is a continuous variable within the population.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000597" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ophthalmoparesis</a></h3>
	Ophthalmoplegia is a paralysis or weakness of one or more of the muscles that control eye movement.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000648" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Optic atrophy</a></h3>
	Atrophy of the optic nerve. Optic atrophy results from the death of the retinal ganglion cell axons that comprise the optic nerve and manifesting as a pale optic nerve on fundoscopy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The diagnosis of optic atrophy is made when the optic disc loses its normal orange-pink color. Optic atrophy is an end stage that arises from myriad causes of optic nerve damage anywhere along the path from the retina to the lateral geniculate. Some of the most common etiologies are advanced glaucoma, optic neuritis, arteritic or non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy or a compressive lesion.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000639" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nystagmus</a></h3>
	Rhythmic, involuntary oscillations of one or both eyes related to abnormality in fixation, conjugate gaze, or vestibular mechanisms.

	Pallor of the perifoveal macula of the retina with appearance of a small circular reddish choroid shape as seen through the fovea centralis due to relative transparancy of the macula.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cataract</a></h3>
	A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000519" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Congenital cataract</a></h3>
	A congenital cataract.<br />

	A structural anomaly of the eye.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002483" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Bulbar signs</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002015" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dysphagia</a></h3>
	Difficulty in swallowing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001260" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dysarthria</a></h3>
	Dysarthric speech is a general description referring to a neurological speech disorder characterized by poor articulation. Depending on the involved neurological structures, dysarthria may be further classified as spastic, flaccid, ataxic, hyperkinetic and hypokinetic, or mixed.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010628" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Facial palsy</a></h3>
	Facial nerve palsy is a dysfunction of cranial nerve VII (the facial nerve) that results in inability to control facial muscles on the affected side with weakness of the muscles of facial expression and eye closure. This can either be present in unilateral or bilateral form.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Several conditions can cause a facial paralysis, e.g. brain tumor, stroke, and Lyme disease. However, if no specific cause can be identified, the condition is known as Bell's palsy. Named after Scottish anatomist Charles Bell, who first described it. Bell's palsy is the most common acute mononeuropathy (disease involving only one nerve) and is the most common cause of acute facial nerve paralysis.

	Reduced strength of the axial musculature (i.e., of the muscles of the head and neck, spine, and ribs).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003750" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Increased muscle fatiguability</a></h3>
	An abnormal, increased fatiguability of the musculature.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010832" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of pain sensation</a></h3>
	Pain is an unpleasant sensation that can range from mild, localized discomfort to agony, whereby the physical part of pain results from nerve stimulation and is often accompanied by an emotional component. This term groups abnormalities in pain sensation presumed to result from abnormalities related to the specific nerve fibers that carry the pain impulses to the brain.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002355" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Difficulty walking</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030007" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: Positive sharp waves</a></h3>
	These are spontaneous firing action potentials stimulated by needle movement of an injured muscle fiber. There is propagation to, but not past, the needle tip. This inhibits the display of the negative deflection of the waveform.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0040131" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal motor nerve conduction velocity</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007002" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Motor axonal neuropathy</a></h3>
	Progressive impairment of function of motor axons with muscle weakness, atrophy, and cramps. The deficits are length-dependent, meaning that muscles innervated by the longest nerves are affected first, so that for instance the arms are affected at a later age than the onset of deficits involving the lower leg.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Distal motor neuropathy is a bundled term that should not be used if more detailed information about the phenotype is available.

This finding is typically demonstrated by muscle biopsy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003805" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Rimmed vacuoles</a></h3>
	Presence of abnormal vacuoles (membrane-bound organelles) in the sarcolemma. On histological staining with hematoxylin and eosin, rimmed vacuoles are popcorn-like clear vacuoles with a densely blue rim. The vacuoles are often associated with cytoplasmic and occasionally intranuclear eosinophilic inclusions.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Rimmed vacuoles are characteristic for inclusion-bosy myositis, but are also seen an a number of other diseases. This term implies that rimmed vacuoles are found histologically. In some cases, the majority of muscle fibers are involved, but in others, rimmed vacuoles can be found in only a minority of fibers.
