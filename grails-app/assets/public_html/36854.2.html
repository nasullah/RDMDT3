  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Unexplained skeletal dysplasia as determined by one of the following:
•	Unknown/undefined skeletal dysplasia detected on skeletal survey by a radiologist with expertise in skeletal dysplasias [expertise is available via DREAMS (http://d-reams.org by contacting: DREAMS&#64;sheffield.ac.uk] OR
•	Skeletal phenotype on skeletal survey consistent with a known disorder for which the common gene mutations for that disorder have been excluded</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Known aetiology 
•	Disproportionate short stature with non-skeletal aetiology
•	Short stature (&lt;0.4th centile) for other non-skeletal reason (e.g. growth hormone deficiency)
•	Skeletal dysplasia within remit of other 100,000 Genomes Project disorder</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">No genes listed</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The term gait disturbance can refer to any disruption of the ability to walk. In general, this can refer to neurological diseases but also fractures or other sources of pain that is triggered upon walking. However, in the current context gait disturbance refers to difficulty walking on the basis of a neurological or muscular disease.

Comment:
If possible, this term should not be used for new annotations. Rather, a more specific term should be sought.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.

Comment:
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.</p>

Comment:
Talipes means (a deformity of) foot and ankle. There are four types of talipes.
1) Talipes equinovarus - the foot is pointing inwards and down (the most common form)
2) Talipes equinovalgus - where the foot points outwards and down
3) Talipes calcaneovarus - where the foot points inwards and up
4) Talipes calcaneovalgus - where the foot points inwards and down.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000175" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft palate</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Cleft palate is a developmental defect of the palate resulting from a failure of fusion of the palatine processes and manifesting as a separation of the roof of the mouth (soft and hard palate).

Comment:
Cleft palate is a developmental defect that occurs between the 7th and 12th week of pregnancy. Normally, the palatine processes fuse during this time to form the soft and hard palate. A failure of fusion results in a cleft palate. The clinical spectrum ranges from bifid uvula, to (incomplete or complete) cleft of the soft palate, up to (complete or incomplete) cleft of both the soft and hard palate.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001385" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hip dysplasia</a></h3>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001371" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Flexion contracture</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A flexion contracture is a bent (flexed) joint that cannot be straightened actively or passively. It is thus a chronic loss of joint motion due to structural changes in muscle, tendons, ligaments, or skin that prevents normal movement of joints.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002650" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Scoliosis</a></h3>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000668" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypodontia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A developmental anomaly characterized by a reduced number of teeth, whereby up to 6 teeth are missing.

Comment:
Hypodontia refers to a reduced number of primary or permanent teeth. Hypodontia may affect either both primary and permanent teeth or only the permanent teeth. Wisdom teeth (the third secondary maxillary and mandibular molar teeth) are not included in this count.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011069" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Increased number of teeth</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The presence of a supernumerary, i.e., extra, tooth or teeth.

Comment:
The most frequent supernumerary tooth is a mesiodens, which occurs between the two maxillary central incisors. Often it fails to erupt, but creates a large anterior diastema, and would not be detected on physical examination (requires X-ray evaluation). This designation excludes coexistence of primary and permanent dentition due to delayed loss of the former. Note that this term does not refer to the situation in which two rows of teeth are seen at the time of eruption of permanent dentition before exfoliation of primary teeth, which can be a normal finding.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000695" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Natal tooth</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Erupted tooth or teeth at birth.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000256" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Macrocephaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Occipitofrontal (head) circumference greater than 97th centile compared to appropriate, age matched, sex-matched normal standards. Alternatively, a apparently increased size of the cranium.

Comment:
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far above the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Macrocephaly is an absolute term. The term relative macrocephaly can be used when the head size centile exceeds the centile for height, for example, head size at the 75th centile with height at the 5th centile for age and sex.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.

Comment:
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.</p>
