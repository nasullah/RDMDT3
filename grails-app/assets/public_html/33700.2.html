						<!-- <h2>Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis Eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Neonates, infants, children and adults with a history of generalised red, dry, peeling skin at birth with a mode of inheritance consistent with autosomal recessive transmission<br />
•	Diagnosis confirmed by consultant dermatologist

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Ichthyosis vulgaris<br />
•	STS-related ichthyosis<br />
•	Syndromic ichthyosis<br />
•	Keratinopathic ichthyosis<br />
•	Acquired ichthyosis

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
TGM1, ALOXE3, ALOX12B, NIPAL4, CYP4F22 and, where appropriate, STS and ABCA12

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007479" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Congenital nonbullous ichthyosiform erythroderma</a></h3>
	The term collodion baby applies to newborns who appear to have an extra layer of skin (known as a collodion membrane) that has a collodion-like quality. It is a descriptive term, not a specific diagnosis or disorder (as such, it is a syndrome). Affected babies are born in a collodion membrane, a shiny waxy outer layer to the skin. This is shed 10-14 days after birth, revealing the main symptom of the disease, extensive scaling of the skin caused by hyperkeratosis. With increasing age, the scaling tends to be concentrated around joints in areas such as the groin, the armpits, the inside of the elbow and the neck. The scales often tile the skin and may resemble fish scales.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007431" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma</a></h3>
	An ichthyosiform abnormality of the skin with congenital onset.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000972" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Palmoplantar hyperkeratosis</a></h3>
	Hyperkeratosis affecting the palm of the hand and the sole of the foot.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001596" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Alopecia</a></h3>
	Loss of hair from the head or body.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001006" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypotrichosis</a></h3>
	Congenital lack of hair growth.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Unlike alopecia, which describes hair loss where formerly there was hair growth, hypotrichosis describes a situation where there wasn't any hair growth in the first place.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010719" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of hair texture</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the texture of the hair.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008392" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Subungual hyperkeratosis</a></h3>
	A thickening of the stratum corneum in the region beneath the nails.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001792" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Small nail</a></h3>
	A nail that is diminished in length and width, i.e., underdeveloped nail.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008404" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nail dystrophy</a></h3>
	Onychodystrophy (nail dystrophy) refers to nail changes apart from changes of the color (nail dyschromia) and involves partial or complete disruption of the various keratinous layers of the nail plate.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Onychodystrophy is a widely used, yet rarely defined term. Onychodystrophy can be caused by congenital nail diseases, systemic disorders, fungal and nonfungal infections, various noninfectious inflammatory dermatologic diseases of the nail unit and tumors. Onychodystrophy can also occur secondarily to systemic drug use.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000656" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ectropion</a></h3>
	An outward turning (eversion) or rotation of the eyelid margin.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Ectropion is frequently associated wit overexposure of the palpebral and scleral conjunctiva and cornea. It usually involves the lower eyelid.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012472" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Eclabion</a></h3>
	A turning outward of the lip or lips, that is, eversion of the lips.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005288" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the nares</a></h3>
	Abnormality of the nostril.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000356" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the outer ear</a></h3>

	Caries is a multifactorial bacterial infection affecting the structure of the tooth. This term has been used to describe the presence of more than expected dental caries.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
It should be noted that it is not always possible to rule out environmental influences and that reports of association between hereditary diseases and susceptibility to dental caries should be regarded with caution.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000194" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Open mouth</a></h3>
	A facial appearance characterized by a permanently or nearly permanently opened mouth.

<br />
Comment:<br />
Any abnormality of the primary (deciduous) or permanent teeth.

	Pruritus is an itch or a sensation that makes a person want to scratch. This term refers to an abnormally increased disposition to experience pruritus.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008064" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ichthyosis</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the skin characterized the presence of excessive amounts of dry surface scales on the skin resulting from an abnormality of keratinization.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The ichthyoses are a group of skin diseases characterized by drying and scaling of skin with the accumulation of thick scales and cracks that may be painful or bleed. The abnormality in ichthyosis lies in am imbalance in the normal lifecycle of skin in which growth is matched with dying and shedding of skin cells. In ichthyosis, skin cells reproduce at a rate faster than dead skin cells can be shed or reproduce at a normal rate with a reduction in the rate of shedding. Either abnormality leads to a build up of dry and scaly skin. Note that this term refers to the morphological abnormality of the skin and not the disorder.
