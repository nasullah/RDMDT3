  <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>

  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- unexplained rod-cone dystrophy/ retinal dystrophy OR
- at least two of the major diagnostic features associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome:
  - Obesity
  - Polydacyly
  - Rod-cone dystrophy/ retinal dystrophy/ retinitis pigmentosa
  - Hypogenitalism 
  - Renal dysplasia</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa without features suggestive of rod-cone dystrophy/ cone-rod dystrophy
- existing molecular confirmation of a diagnosis of Bardet-Biedl syndrome or another ciliopathy</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 - Genome-wide copy number variation testing (e.g. aCGH, SNP array or other genomic microarray)
 - ARL6, ALMS1, BBS1, BBS10, BBS12, BBS2, BBS4, BBS5, BBS7, BBS9, MKKS, MKS1 and TTC8</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001513" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Obesity</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Body weight that is grossly above the acceptable or desirable weight, usually due to accumulation of excess fats in the body. The standards may vary with age, sex, genetic or cultural background. In the body mass index (BMI), a BMI greater than 30.0 kg/m2 is considered obese, and a BMI greater than 40.0 kg/m2 is considered morbidly obese.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.

Comment:
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000708" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Behavioral abnormality</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of mental functioning including various affective, behavioural, cognitive and perceptual abnormalities.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000510" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Retinitis pigmentosa</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Hereditary degeneration and atrophy of the retina.

Comment:
Retinitis pigmentosa is a group of hereditary diseases of the eye. However, the term retinitis pigmentosa has also been used to describe the retinal findings characteristic of these diseases but also seen on other diseases such as Usher syndrome. It is preferable to describe the findings precisely if possible, but this term is kept for convenience.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000556" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Retinal dystrophy</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000648" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Optic atrophy</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Atrophy of the optic nerve. Optic atrophy results from the death of the retinal ganglion cell axons that comprise the optic nerve and manifesting as a pale optic nerve on fundoscopy.

Comment:
The diagnosis of optic atrophy is made when the optic disc loses its normal orange-pink color. Optic atrophy is an end stage that arises from myriad causes of optic nerve damage anywhere along the path from the retina to the lateral geniculate. Some of the most common etiologies are advanced glaucoma, optic neuritis, arteritic or non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy or a compressive lesion.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000483" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Astigmatism</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Astigmatism describes a refractive error  characterized by a difference in the horizontal and vertical  curvature of the cornea.

Comment:
The irregular curvature associated with astigmatism means that the optical system is not symmetric about the optical axis. Most commonly the cornea is affected such that the refractive power in one meridian is less than that of the perpendicular axis. Astigmatism of significant degree causes blurry vision.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000486" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Strabismus</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Strabismus (also known as squint) is a condition in which the eyes are not properly aligned with each other.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cataract</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.

Comment:
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Digits that appear disproportionately short compared to the hand/foot. The word brachydactyly is used to describe a series of Mendelian diseases characterized by distinct patterns of shortened digits (brachydactyly types A-E). This is the sense used here, however, it is preferable to described the observed phenotypic abnormalities precisely.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010442" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Polydactyly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A congenital anomaly characterized by the presence of supernumerary fingers or toes.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001159" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Syndactyly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Webbing or fusion of the fingers or toes, involving soft parts only or including bone structure. Bony fusions are revered to as &quot;bony&quot; syndactyly if the fusion occurs in a radio-ulnar axis. Fusions of bones of the fingers or toes in a proximo-distal axis are refered to as &quot;symphalangism&quot;.

Comment:
Syndactyly may be partial or complete. In complete syndactyly, the skin is joined all the way to the fingertip. In partial (incomplete) syndactyly, the skin is only joined part of the distance to the fingertip.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000218" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">High palate</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Height of the palate more than 2 SD above the mean (objective) or palatal height at the level of the first permanent molar more than twice the height of the teeth (subjective).

Comment:
The measuring device for this assessment is described in (Hall JG, Froster-Iskenius UG, Allanson JE, Gripp K, Slavotinek A. 2006. Handbook of Normal Physical Measurements. 2nd edition. Oxford Medical, publishers). A high palate is often associated with a narrow palate. However, a narrow palate can easily give a false appearance of a high palate. Height and width of the palate should be assessed and coded separately. We do not recommend the subjective determination because this term can be overused and
applied inaccurately.</p>
