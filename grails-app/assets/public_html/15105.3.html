<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Hypoglycaemia onset before 12 years of age<br />
- Drug-treated for â‰¥3 months or pancreatectomy<br />
- Intravenous glucose infusion rate required to maintain normoglycaemia >8mg/kg/min<br />
- Detectable serum insulin or C-Peptide when blood glucose is less than 3mmol/L

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Hypoglycaemia in the neonatal period which resolved without treatment<br />
- Hypoglycaemia in the context of systemic neonatal disease e.g. sepsis

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001987" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperammonemia</a></h3>
	An increased concentration of ammonia in the blood.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001520" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Large for gestational age</a></h3>
	The term large for gestational age applies to babies whose birth weight lies above the 90th percentile for that gestational age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Fetal macrosomia has been defined in several different ways, including birth weight of 4000-4500 g (8 lb 13 oz to 9 lb 15 oz) or greater than 90% for gestational age after correcting for neonatal sex and ethnicity. Based on these definitions, macrosomia affects 1-10% of all pregnancies. A diagnosis of fetal macrosomia can be made only by measuring birth weight after delivery; therefore, the condition is confirmed only retrospectively, ie, after delivery of the neonate.
