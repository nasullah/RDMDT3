  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Patients referred for Fanconi anaemia chromosome breakage testing, but who are negative for elevated chromosome breakage with mitomycin C/diepoxybutane
- Patients with two or more of the following clinical features which overlap with Fanconi:
  - Skin: hyperpigmentation; Cafe au lait spots; Hypopigmentation
  - Microsomia: short stature
  - Upper limbs: Absent/hypoplastic thumbs or radii
  - Head and face: Microcephaly; micrognathia
  - Hypogenitalia in males or females
  - Renal: Ectopic or pelvic; abnormal, horseshoe
  - Haematology: Unexplained cytopenia</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Patients referred for Fanconi anaemia chromosome breakage testing, who are positive for elevated chromosome breakage with mitomycin C/diepoxybutane.</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000957" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cafe-au-lait spot</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Cafe-au-lait spots are hyperpigmented lesions that can vary in color from light brown to dark brown with smooth borders and having a size of 1.5 cm or more in adults and 0.5 cm or more in children.

Comment:
The phrase cafe-au-lait comes from the French word for milk-coffee. A single cafe-au-lait spot can be an isolated finding in otherwise normal individuals. Multiple cafe-au-lait spots often indicate the presence of neurofibromatosis type 1 but may also be seen in other diseases including McCune-Albright syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Fanconi anemia.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A reduction in erythrocytes volume or hemoglobin concentration.

Comment:
Anemia is not a specific entity but can result from many underlying pathologic processes. The three main causes of anemia are blood loss, decreased or faulty red blood cell production, and increased destruction of red blood cells. Various classifications are in clinical use including a classification according to the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the erythrocytes: microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic. Anemias can also be classified according to variations in cell size and shape, as reflected by the red-cell distribution width (RDW). Additionally, anemias can be classified into those of inadequate production and hemolytic anemias.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000978" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Bruising susceptibility</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An ecchymosis (bruise) refers to the skin discoloration caused by the escape of blood into the tissues from ruptured blood vessels. This term refers to an abnormally increased susceptibility to bruising. The corresponding phenotypic abnormality is generally elicited on medical history as a report of frequent ecchymoses or bruising without adequate trauma.

Comment:
An ecchymosis is defined as being larger than 1 cm in size.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Larger than normal size of erythrocytes.

Comment:
Macrocytosis refers to a mean cell volume (MCV) greater than 100 fL. If macrocytosis is an isolated abnormality, the amount of hemoglobin in the cell increases proportionately, so the mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) remains within normal limits.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A complete duplication affecting one or more of the phalanges of the thumb. As opposed to a partial duplication were there is still a variable degree of fusion between the duplicated bones, a complete duplication leads to two separate bones appearing side to side (radio-ulnar axis) as seen on x-rays. A duplication leading to an accesory bone appearing in the proximo-distal axis on x-rays, this is actually a different entity called a Pseudoepiphyses (see according terms) sometimes also refered to as Hyperphalangism.</p>

Although there is no universally accepted definition of short stature, many refer to &quot;short stature&quot; as height more than 2 standard deviations below the mean for age and gender (or below the 3rd percentile for age and gender dependent norms).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Small for gestational age</a></h3>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.

Comment:
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000028" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cryptorchidism</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testis in inguinal canal. That is, absence of one or both testes from the scrotum owing to failure of the testis or testes to descend through the inguinal canal to the testis.

Comment:
The gonad is mobile and can be retracted superiorly by the cremaster muscle reflex stimulated, for instance, by cold or touch. A retracted testis is not cryptorchidism. An abdominal testis cannot be distinguished by physical examination from an (Apparently) absent testis and requires radiological (or, rarely, surgical) procedures for assessment.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.

Comment:
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.

Comment:
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).</p>
