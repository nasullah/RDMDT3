  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Persistent microscopic haematuria AND one or both of: 
- Family history of kidney failure or microscopic haematuria 
- Kidney biopsy showing characteristic electron micrographic features of Alport syndrome or thin glomerular basement membrane nephropathy

Individuals with severe or syndromic disease should be recruited according to standard guidance, typically as trios. 
Disease status of apparently unaffected participants should be determined according to standard clinical practice to detect cryptic disease.  
In other cases, unaffected individuals should not be recruited. Recruitment in such families should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Known or suspected renal or urinary tract malignancy
- Known or suspected renal calculi
- Known monogenic cause of microscopic haematuria</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
COL4A3, COL4A4 and COL4A5 where indicated by the phenotype.</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term &#39;psychomotor retardation&#39; is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.

Comment:
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001999" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal facial shape</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormal morphology (form) of the face or its components.

Comment:
This term now covers many of the historical inexact descriptions such as Bird-like facies that probably should be avoided in modern genetics. This portion of the Ontology should be revised.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000028" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cryptorchidism</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testis in inguinal canal. That is, absence of one or both testes from the scrotum owing to failure of the testis or testes to descend through the inguinal canal to the testis.

Comment:
The gonad is mobile and can be retracted superiorly by the cremaster muscle reflex stimulated, for instance, by cold or touch. A retracted testis is not cryptorchidism. An abdominal testis cannot be distinguished by physical examination from an (Apparently) absent testis and requires radiological (or, rarely, surgical) procedures for assessment.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000062" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ambiguous genitalia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A genital phenotype that is not clearly assignable to a single gender. Ambiguous genitalia can be evaluated using the Prader scale: Prader 0: Normal female external genitalia. Prader 1: Female external genitalia with clitoromegaly. Prader 2: Clitoromegaly with partial labial fusion forming a funnel-shaped urogenital sinus. Prader 3: Increased phallic enlargement. Complete labioscrotal fusion forming a urogenital sinus with a single opening. Prader 4: Complete scrotal fusion with urogenital opening at the base or on the shaft of the phallus. Prader 5: Normal male external genitalia. The diagnosis of ambiguous genitalia is made for Prader 1-4.

Comment:
Note that this term can include or combine variations in size and shape, with partial or complete absence of structures. It is preferable to describe the individual components, which are defined below. It is nonetheless a widely used bundled term and as such is retained here. The distinction of this finding from a marked degree of Hypospadias is an example of how this term can be problematic. Genetic gender is determined at fertilization, whereby the presence of a Y chromosome determines male gender. Normally, genetic gender determines gonadal gender which in turn determines phenotypic gender. Testicular development is an active process requiring expression of the primary testis determining gene SRY, which is located on the Y chromosome.</p>
