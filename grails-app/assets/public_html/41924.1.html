  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Established diagnosis of epilepsy, confirmed by a neurologist

AND with at least one additional phenotype from: intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, structural abnormality (e.g. dysmorphism, cerebral or somatic malformation), unexplained cognitive/memory decline

OR
Consanguineous parents</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Case falls into one of the other GeL epilepsy disease categories
Focal, unilateral cerebral malformations</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice: 
As dictated by local practice and clinical phenotype including consideration of SCN1A</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.

Comment:
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002384" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Focal seizures with impairment of consciousness or awareness</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A partial seizure characterized by impairment or loss of consciousness.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002349" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Focal seizures without impairment of consciousness or awareness</a></h3>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002069" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Generalized tonic-clonic seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Generalized tonic-clonic seizures are generalized seizures with bilateral symmetrical tonic contraction then bilateral clonic contractions of somatic muscles usually associated with autonomic phenomena.

Comment:
In a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, the patient suddenly loses conciousness, the eyes roll back, and the entire body musculature undergoes tonic contractions. In the clonic phase of the seizure, there are rhythmic contractions of the musculature alternating with relaxation of all muscle groups. Loss of sphincter control during the seizure is common. This form of seizure was formerly commonly called grand mal seizure.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007270" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Atypical absence seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Absence seizures characterized by insidious begin and end and often prolonged duration, accompanied by slow spike-wave discharges on EEG.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002123" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Generalized myoclonic seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Seizures with sudden, brief (&lt; 100 msec) involuntary single or multiple contraction(s) of muscles(s) or muscle groups of variable topography (axial, proximal limb, distal).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010818" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Generalized tonic seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Generalized seizures with sustained increase in muscle contraction lasting a few seconds to minutes.

Comment:
Characterized by a sudden increase in muscle tone whereby the body, arms, or legs make sudden stiffening movements and consciousness is usually preserved. Tonic seizures can occur during sleep. Tonic seizures usually affect both sides of the body, and cause a fall if the affected person was standing when the seizure started.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010819" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Atonic seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Seizures characterized by a sudden loss or diminution of muscle tone, which may be fragmentary, confined to a segment (limb, jaw, head), or massive, leading to a slumping to the ground .</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007359" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Focal seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Seizures of which initial semiology indicates, or is consistent with, initial activation of only part of one cerebral hemisphere.

Comment:
Partial seizures can be classified as simple (consciousness is maintained) or complex (consciousness is impaired or lost).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002353" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EEG abnormality</a></h3>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011185" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EEG with focal epileptiform discharges</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">EEG discharges recorded in particular areas of the A localized (focal) abnormality in cerebral electrical activity recorded along the scalp by electroencephalography (EEG).

Comment:
Note that a focal EEG abnormality is not synonymous with &quot;focal epileptiform discharges&quot; because a focal EEG abnormality is not necessarily epileptiform (e.g., it could be a focal slowing).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010841" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Multifocal epileptiform discharges</a></h3>

Comment:
Spikes (&lt;70 ms) and sharp waves (70-200 ms) are sharp transient waves that have a strong association with epilepsy. No difference is noted in terms of clinical significance of spikes and sharp waves. Significant spikes usually are followed by a slow wave.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormality of the basal ganglia.

Comment:
The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei (striatum, pallidum substantia nigra, and the subthalamic nucleus) at the base of the forebrain that are connected to the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, and other areas. The basal ganglia subserve motor functions that are distinct from those of the pyramidal (corticospinal) tract, for which reason neurologic abnormalities caused by lesions to the basal ganglia are often referred to as extrapyramidal.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.

Comment:
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term &#39;psychomotor retardation&#39; is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.

Comment:
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000717" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Autism</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. Autism begins in childhood. It is marked by the presence of markedly abnormal or impaired development in social interaction and communication and a markedly restricted repertoire of activity and interest. Manifestations of the disorder vary greatly depending on the developmental level and chronological age of the individual (DSM-IV).

Comment:
The term refers to the diagnosis of autism and is left for convenience. However, it is preferable to annotate the exact phenotypic abnormalities rather than merely the diagnostic category autism.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100543" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cognitive impairment</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormality in the process of thought including the ability to process information.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000726" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dementia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A loss of global cognitive ability of sufficient amount to interfere with normal social or occupational function. Dementia represents a loss of previously present cognitive abilities, generally in adults, and can affect memory, thinking, language, judgment, and behavior.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.

Comment:
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000256" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Macrocephaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Occipitofrontal (head) circumference greater than 97th centile compared to appropriate, age matched, sex-matched normal standards. Alternatively, a apparently increased size of the cranium.

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormal morphology (form) of the face or its components.

Comment:
This term now covers many of the historical inexact descriptions such as Bird-like facies that probably should be avoided in modern genetics. This portion of the Ontology should be revised.</p>
