						<!-- <h2>Familial Non-syndromic cleft lip and or familial cleft palate eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Familial cleft lip with or without cleft palate, or cleft palate alone<br />
AND<br />
•	At least 4 affected family members over at least 3 generations, OR<br />
•	At least 3 affected siblings with no additional family history<br />
AND<br />
•	At least 3 affected individuals available to participate in the study

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Van der Woude syndrome or Stickler syndrome clinically diagnosed<br />
•	Syndromic clefting disorders (see syndromic clefting disorders eligibility criteria)

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
- aCGH or equivalent<br />
- IRF6 if lip pits in any member or cleft lip AND palate present in the family

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

						<!-- <h2>Familial Non-syndromic cleft lip and or familial cleft palate phenotypes</h2> -->

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000202" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Oral cleft</a></h3>
	The presence of a cleft in the oral cavity, the two main types of which are cleft lip and cleft palate. In cleft lip, there is the congenital failure of the maxillary and median nasal processes to fuse, forming a groove or fissure in the lip. In cleft palate, there is a congenital failure of the palate to fuse properly, forming a grooved depression or fissure in the roof of the mouth. Clefts of the lip and palate can occur individually or together. It is preferable to code each defect separately.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000204" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft upper lip</a></h3>
	A gap in the upper lip. This is a congenital defect resulting from nonfusion of tissues of the lip during embryonal development.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000161" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Median cleft lip</a></h3>
	A type of cleft lip presenting as a midline (median) gap in the upper lip.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100335" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Non-midline cleft lip</a></h3>
	Clefting of the upper lip affecting the lateral portions of the upper lip rather than the midline/median region.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100336" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Bilateral cleft lip</a></h3>
	A non-midline cleft of the upper lip on the left and right sides.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100333" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Unilateral cleft lip</a></h3>
	A non-midline cleft of the upper lip on one side only.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011340" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Incomplete cleft of the upper lip</a></h3>
	A subtle unilateral cleft of the upper lip, which may appear as a small indentation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010289" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Alveolar ridge cleft</a></h3>
	A gap (cleft) affecting one of the alveolar ridges.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010281" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft lower lip</a></h3>
	A gap in the lower lip.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000175" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft palate</a></h3>
	Cleft palate is a developmental defect of the palate resulting from a failure of fusion of the palatine processes and manifesting as a separation of the roof of the mouth (soft and hard palate).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Cleft palate is a developmental defect that occurs between the 7th and 12th week of pregnancy. Normally, the palatine processes fuse during this time to form the soft and hard palate. A failure of fusion results in a cleft palate. The clinical spectrum ranges from bifid uvula, to (incomplete or complete) cleft of the soft palate, up to (complete or incomplete) cleft of both the soft and hard palate.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0410005" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft hard palate</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000185" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft soft palate</a></h3>
	Cleft of the soft palate (also known as the velum, or muscular palate) as a result of a developmental defect occurring between the 7th and 12th week of pregnancy. Cleft soft palate can cause functional abnormalities of the Eustachian tube with resulting middle ear anomalies and hearing difficulties, as well as speech problems associated with hypernasal speech due to velopharyngeal insufficiency.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011819" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Submucous cleft soft palate</a></h3>
	A cleft of the muscular (soft) portion of the palate that is covered by mucous membrane. Soft-palate submucous clefts are characterized by a midline deficiency or lack of muscle tissue.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Often, submucous cleft palate is associated with bifid uvula, but this should be coded separately. The muscles of the soft palate may not function properly, leading to speech problems, middle ear disease, and swallowing difficulties.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000193" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Bifid uvula</a></h3>
	Uvula separated into two parts most easily seen at the tip.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000220" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Velopharyngeal insufficiency</a></h3>
	Inability of velopharyngeal sphincter to sufficiently separate the nasal cavity from the oral cavity during speech.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000196" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Lower lip pit</a></h3>
	Depression located on the vermilion of the lower lip, usually paramedian.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
A lip pit may be connected by a fistula to mucous minor salivary glands in the lower lip. In addition, a lip pit may on occasion be seen with a surrounding tissue elevation (mound). Pits located at the labial commisure (cheilon) are distinct from lip pits (see Commissural pit).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000347" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Micrognathia</a></h3>
	Developmental hypoplasia of the mandible.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Mandibular hypoplasia, also known as micrognathia, is a term that describes an abnormally small lower jaw.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000668" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypodontia</a></h3>
	A developmental anomaly characterized by a reduced number of teeth, whereby up to 6 teeth are missing.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hypodontia refers to a reduced number of primary or permanent teeth. Hypodontia may affect either both primary and permanent teeth or only the permanent teeth. Wisdom teeth (the third secondary maxillary and mandibular molar teeth) are not included in this count.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000201" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pierre-Robin sequence</a></h3>
	Pierre Robin malformation is a sequence of developmental malformations characterized by micrognathia (mandibular hypoplasia), glossoptosis and cleft palate.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
	A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001627" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of cardiac morphology</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the heart.
