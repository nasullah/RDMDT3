						<!-- <h2>Ectodermal dysplasia without a known gene mutation Eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
- Ectodermal dysplasia i.e. abnormality of at least two of the following: - nails - teeth - hair - sweating -  With or without additional phenotypic features e.g. clefting, limb defects, hearing loss.

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
â€¢	Mutation in known ectodermal dysplasia gene

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
-	According to phenotype: EDA, EDAR, EDARADD, WNT10A and/or TP63

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

						<!-- <h2>Ectodermal dysplasia without a known gene mutation Phenotypes</h2> -->

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001598" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Concave nail</a></h3>
	The natural longitudinal (posterodistal) convex arch is not present or is inverted.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Koilonychia literally means spoon nails. This often results in a saucer- or spoon-shaped nail and the free edge of the nail is typically everted. The affected digits should be specified. Note that the bundled term koilonychia is an abnormal shape of the fingernail where the nail has raised ridges and is thin and concave.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001805" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Thick nail</a></h3>
	Nail that appears thick when viewed on end.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
There is a build up of keratin causing the nail plate to lift away from the nail bed. The thickened nail plate is usually very hard. Onychauxis and onychogryposis are dystrophic diseases of the nail in which the nail plate becomes decidedly hypertrophied. The differentiation of the two entities is only one of degree of severity.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001804" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypoplastic fingernail</a></h3>
	Underdevelopment of a fingernail.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001798" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anonychia</a></h3>
	Aplasia of the nail.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Total absence of nails.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001807" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ridged nail</a></h3>
	Longitudinal, linear prominences in the nail plate.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
There may be only one, or several ridges. The affected digits should be specified.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001803" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nail pits</a></h3>
	Small (typically about 1 mm or less in size) depressions on the dorsal nail surface.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001806" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Onycholysis</a></h3>
	Detachment of the nail from the nail bed.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001795" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperconvex nail</a></h3>
	When viewed on end (with the digit tip pointing toward the examiner's eye) the curve of the nail forms a tighter curve of convexity.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
No objective standards were identified for this finding. Another way to describe this finding is to say that the observed curve has a smaller radius than does the typical nail. The affected digits should be specified.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000966" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypohidrosis</a></h3>
	Abnormally diminished capacity to sweat.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000970" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anhidrosis</a></h3>
	Inability to sweat.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000975" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperhidrosis</a></h3>
	Abnormal excessive perspiration (sweating).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001945" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Fever</a></h3>
	Elevated body temperature due to failed thermoregulation.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hyperthermia is defined as a temperature greater than 37.5-38.3 ??C (100-101 ??F).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002046" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Heat intolerance</a></h3>
	The inability to maintain a comfortably body temperature in warm or hot weather.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Heat intolerance tends to produce a feeling of being overheated and profuse diaphoresis (sweating). Many, but not all, cases of heat intolerance are related to thyrotoxicosis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000698" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Conical tooth</a></h3>
	An abnormal conical form of the teeth, that is, a tooth whose sides converge or taper together incisally.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000679" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Taurodontia</a></h3>
	Increased volume of dental pulp of permanent molar.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Body of the tooth and pulp chamber is enlarged.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006297" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypoplasia of dental enamel</a></h3>
	Developmental hypoplasia of the dental enamel.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that the term enamel dysplasia was previously used for this feature but is no longer recommended.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000687" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Widely spaced teeth</a></h3>
	Increased spaces (diastemata) between most of the teeth in the same dental arch.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Wide spacing can be secondary to increased room by an unusually large dental arch, microdontia or mixed primary and secondary dentition. It should be carefully noted that slight spacing between the primary teeth is normal, so experience in evaluation is important in determining this feature. This descriptor must be distinguished from Diastema.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001006" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypotrichosis</a></h3>
	Congenital lack of hair growth.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Unlike alopecia, which describes hair loss where formerly there was hair growth, hypotrichosis describes a situation where there wasn't any hair growth in the first place.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002293" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Alopecia of scalp</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002299" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Brittle hair</a></h3>
	Fragile, easily breakable hair, i.e., with reduced tensile strength.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Brittle is used to describe hair which is very short because of an abnormality is in the structure of the shaft. Microscopically the ends appear fractured. Affected patients may report bits of hair on the collar or pillow. Brittle hair can be distinguished from hypotrichosis due to slow or deficient growth (e.g., due to hypotrichosis simplex) and hypotrichosis due to the hair being fine and soft where the hair just wears out too quickly (e.g., due to ectodermal dysplasia).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002213" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Fine hair</a></h3>
	Hair that is fine or thin to the touch.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002223" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Absent eyebrow</a></h3>
	Absence of the eyebrow.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000535" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sparse eyebrow</a></h3>
	Decreased density/number and/or decreased diameter of eyebrow hairs.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Sparseness can be regional (medial, central, lateral) or total. These modifiers should be incorporated into the term, when appropriate.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005338" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sparse lateral eyebrow</a></h3>
	Decreased density/number and/or decreased diameter of lateral eyebrow hairs.<br />

	The presence of a basal cell carcinoma of the skin.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
A basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer which rarely metastasizes, but is still considered malignant because it can cause significant destruction and disfigurement by invading surrounding tissues. In 80 percent of all cases, basal cell cancers are found on the head and neck or on other sun-exposed areas of the body. Apart from sporadic basal cell carcinoma, there are hereditary conditions such as the basal cell nevus syndrome where patients develop multiple basal cell carcinomas throughout life.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100257" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ectrodactyly</a></h3>
	A condition in which middle parts of the hands and/or feet (digits and meta-carpals and -tarsals) are missing giving a cleft appearance. The severity is very variable ranging from slightly hypoplastic 3rd toe/fingers over absent 2nd or 3rd toes/fingers as far as oligo- or monodactyl hands and/or feet.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hands and feet in one individual might be similarly affected or very diverse and the phenotype is very variable even within families. Penetrance is reduced and some idnividuals have been observed presenting only with unilateral smaller 2nd toe which may be overlooked till a much more severly affected family member is seen.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001171" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Split hand</a></h3>
	A condition in which middle parts of the hand (fingers and metacarpals) are missing giving a cleft appearance. The severity is very variable ranging from slightly hypoplastic middle fingers over absent middel fingers as far as oligo- or monodactyl hands.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001839" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Split foot</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012385" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Camptodactyly</a></h3>
	The distal interphalangeal joint and/or the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fingers or toes cannot be extended to 180 degrees by either active or passive extension.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100490" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Camptodactyly of finger</a></h3>
	The distal interphalangeal joint and/or the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fingers cannot be extended to 180 degrees by either active or passive extension.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that some restrict the use of the term to inability to extend the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fifth finger. We do not restrict the term in this way. This term should not be used if the patient has Clenched hand. A similar effect can be created by radial angulation within the distal phalanx with thickening of the epiphysis, which is called Kirner deformity or dystelephalangy. The affected digits should be specified.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001836" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Camptodactyly of toe</a></h3>
	Camptodactyly is a painless flexion contracture of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint that is usually gradually progressive. This term refers to camptodactyly of one or more toes.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012725" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cutaneous syndactyly</a></h3>
	A soft tissue continuity in the A/P axis between two digits that extends distally to at least the level of the proximal interphalangeal joints, or a soft tissue continuity in the A/P axis between two digits that lies significantly distal to the flexion crease that overlies the metacarpophalangeal or metatarsophalangeal joint of the adjacent digits.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001770" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Toe syndactyly</a></h3>
	Webbing or fusion of the toes, involving soft parts only or including bone structure. Bony fusions are revered to as "bony" Syndactyly if the fusion occurs in a radio-ulnar axis. Fusions of bones of the toes in a proximo-distal axis are refered to as "Symphalangism".
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006101" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Finger syndactyly</a></h3>
	Webbing or fusion of the fingers, involving soft parts only or including bone structure. Bony fusions are revered to as "bony" Syndactyly if the fusion occurs in a radio-ulnar axis. Fusions of bones of the fingers in a proximo-distal axis are refered to as "Symphalangism".
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002007" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Frontal bossing</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000218" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">High palate</a></h3>
	Height of the palate more than 2 SD above the mean (objective) or palatal height at the level of the first permanent molar more than twice the height of the teeth (subjective).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The measuring device for this assessment is described in (Hall JG, Froster-Iskenius UG, Allanson JE, Gripp K, Slavotinek A. 2006. Handbook of Normal Physical Measurements. 2nd edition. Oxford Medical, publishers). A high palate is often associated with a narrow palate. However, a narrow palate can easily give a false appearance of a high palate. Height and width of the palate should be assessed and coded separately. We do not recommend the subjective determination because this term can be overused and<br />
applied inaccurately.

	Partial fusion of the upper and lower eyelid margins by single or multiple bands of tissue.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
A minimally expressed form, especially when located fully laterally, may be more difficult to ascertain and would be a subjective feature. A band may break and leave no evidence of its presence. Note that the term is distinct from cryptophthalmos.

Hypodontia refers to a reduced number of primary or permanent teeth. Hypodontia may affect either both primary and permanent teeth or only the permanent teeth. Wisdom teeth (the third secondary maxillary and mandibular molar teeth) are not included in this count.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000674" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anodontia</a></h3>
	The congenital absence of all teeth.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Anodontia can affect both primary and permanent teeth. Alternatively, there can be anodontia of just the permanent teeth. Anodontia must be distinguished from non-erupted teeth.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000691" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microdontia</a></h3>
	Decreased size of the teeth, which can be defined as a mesiodistal tooth diameter (width) more than 2 SD below mean. Alternatively, an apparently decreased maximum width of tooth.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Standard reference has means and standard deviations by gender [Moyers et al, 1976]. It is easy to measure the width of teeth, for which reason the definition of microdontia can be made with reference to the width of the tooth. However, microdontia means that the overall size of the tooth is decreased. In microdontia, the gaps between the teeth, particularly the anterior upper and lower teeth, are increased, creating diastemata. This should be assessed and coded separately.

	Eczema is a form of dermatitis. The term eczema is broadly applied to a range of persistent skin conditions and can be related to a number of underlying conditions. Manifestations of eczema can include dryness and recurring skin rashes with redness, skin edema, itching and dryness, crusting, flaking, blistering, cracking, oozing, or bleeding.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004322" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short stature</a></h3>
	A height below that which is expected according to age and gender norms. Although there is no universally accepted definition of short stature, many refer to "short stature" as height more than 2 standard deviations below the mean for age and gender (or below the 3rd percentile for age and gender dependent norms).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001159" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Syndactyly</a></h3>
	Webbing or fusion of the fingers or toes, involving soft parts only or including bone structure. Bony fusions are revered to as "bony" syndactyly if the fusion occurs in a radio-ulnar axis. Fusions of bones of the fingers or toes in a proximo-distal axis are refered to as "symphalangism".<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Syndactyly may be partial or complete. In complete syndactyly, the skin is joined all the way to the fingertip. In partial (incomplete) syndactyly, the skin is only joined part of the distance to the fingertip.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
	Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000204" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft upper lip</a></h3>
	A gap in the upper lip. This is a congenital defect resulting from nonfusion of tissues of the lip during embryonal development.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000175" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft palate</a></h3>
	Cleft palate is a developmental defect of the palate resulting from a failure of fusion of the palatine processes and manifesting as a separation of the roof of the mouth (soft and hard palate).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Cleft palate is a developmental defect that occurs between the 7th and 12th week of pregnancy. Normally, the palatine processes fuse during this time to form the soft and hard palate. A failure of fusion results in a cleft palate. The clinical spectrum ranges from bifid uvula, to (incomplete or complete) cleft of the soft palate, up to (complete or incomplete) cleft of both the soft and hard palate.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cataract</a></h3>
	A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000430" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Underdeveloped nasal alae</a></h3>
	Thinned, deficient, or excessively arched ala nasi.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The alae nasi are the lateral portions of the nose or the wings of the nostrils, which partly encircle the nostrils (nares). They are usually about the width of the columella, but vary greatly depending on the shape of the nostril. Note that individuals may be described as having a Cleft ala nasi, but have a severely underdeveloped ala nasi. In an underdeveloped ala the continuity of the tissue encircling the nostril is undisturbed while in a cleft it is disrupted. With severe hypoplasia of the nasal alae, the nasal tip may appear depressed.

<br />
Comment:<br />
A saddle-nose deformity can be congenital or acquired (e.g., traumatic) and is associated with structural compromise of the nasoseptal cartilage leading to decreased dorsal nasal structural support. A depression of the dorsum of the nose with loss of nasal tip support and definition, shortened (vertical) nasal length, overrotation of the nasal tip, and retrusion of the nasal spine and caudal septum.

Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.
