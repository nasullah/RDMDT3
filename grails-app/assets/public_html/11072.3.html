						<!-- <h2>Primary immunodeficiency disorders Eligibility</h2> -->
Relevant diseases:<br />
<br />
- A- or hypo-gammaglobulinaemia <br />
- Agranulocytosis<br />
- Congenital neutropaenia<br />
- SCID<br />
- Combined B and T cell defect

<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Suspected primary immunodeficiency diagnosed by a consultant immunologist, particularly if familial.<br />
- Appropriate available diagnostic tests should have ruled out mutations in relevant known genes.<br />
- All cases must be discussed and approved by the PID-MDT at the recruiting GMC

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Known genetic cause already identified in proband or family member with similar phenotype.<br />
- Secondary immunodeficiency likely

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype.

<h3>Genes</h3>
 

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002664" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neoplasm</a></h3>
	An organ or organ-system abnormality that consists of uncontrolled autonomous cell-proliferation which can occur in any part of the body as a benign or malignant neoplasm (tumour).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies neoplasms into four main groups: (i) benign neoplasm, (ii) in situ neoplasm, (iii) malignant neoplasm, and (iv) neoplasm of uncertain or unknown behavior. A malignant neoplasm is also known as cancer.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002665" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Lymphoma</a></h3>
	A cancer originating in lymphocytes and presenting as a solid tumor of lymhpoid cells.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001909" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Leukemia</a></h3>
	A cancer of the blood and bone marrow characterized by an abnormal proliferation of leukocytes.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002719" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent infections</a></h3>
	Increased susceptibility to microbial infections, as manifested by recurrent episodes of infection.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002718" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent bacterial infections</a></h3>
	Increased susceptibility to bacterial infections, as manifested by recurrent episodes of bacterial infection.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002841" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent fungal infections</a></h3>
	Increased susceptibility to fungal infections, as manifested by recurrent episodes of fungal infection.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004429" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent viral infections</a></h3>
	Increased susceptibility to viral infections, as manifested by recurrent episodes of viral infection.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000872" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hashimoto thyroiditis</a></h3>
	A chronic, autoimmune type of thyroiditis associated with hypothyroidism.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001890" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Autoimmune hemolytic anemia</a></h3>
	An autoimmune form of hemolytic anemia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001904" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Autoimmune neutropenia</a></h3>
	Autoimmune-induced neutropenia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001973" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Autoimmune thrombocytopenia</a></h3>
	The presence of thrombocytopenia in combination with detection of antiplatelet antibodies.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Autoimmune thrombocytopenia is causes by accelerated destruction of auto-antibody sensitized platelets in the reticular-endothelial<br />
system. Common etiologies include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), Drug-induced autoimmune thrombocytopenia, and autoimmune thrombocytopenia following viral infection.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002725" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Systemic lupus erythematosus</a></h3>
	A chronic, relapsing, inflammatory, and often febrile multisystemic disorder of connective tissue, characterized principally by involvement of the skin, joints, kidneys, and serosal membranes.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This is a bundled term that describes a disease rather than a phenotypic feature, but is left for convenience for annotations of lupus conceived of as a feature of another disease.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003493" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Antinuclear antibody positivity</a></h3>
	The presence of autoantibodies in the serum that react against nuclei or nuclear components.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are found in patients with a number of different autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis, scleroderma, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, juvenile diabetes mellitus, Addison disease, vitiligo, pernicious anemia, glomerulonephritis, and pulmonary fibrosis. ANAs can display various staining patterns such as homogeneous or diffuse; speckled; nucleolar; and peripheral or rim.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002923" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Rheumatoid factor positive</a></h3>
	The presence in the serum of an autoantibody directed against the Fc portion of IgG.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003262" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Smooth muscle antibody positivity</a></h3>
	The presence in serum of antibodies against smooth muscle.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Anti smooth muscle antibody (SMA) may be present in a number of conditions including chronic active hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, cirrhosis, and infectious mononucleosis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003613" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Antiphospholipid antibody positivity</a></h3>
	The presence of circulating autoantibodies to phospholipids.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This group of autoantibodies comprises anticardiolipin, antiphosphatidylinositol, atiphosphatidylglycerol, and antiphosphatidylserine antibodies.
