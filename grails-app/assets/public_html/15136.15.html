  <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>

  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Patients at any age with fatigable weakness and fluctuating motor symptoms
- Clinical neurophysiology revealing a neuromuscular transmission defect (repetitive nerve stimulation, or Single fibre EMG)
- Review of patient data by CMS NHS Highly Specialised Services for Rare Diseases service</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Response to immunosuppressive treatment
- Presence of anti- AChR or MuSK antibodies
- Muscle biopsy indicative of mitochondrial disorder. Muscle biopsy giving clear indication of dystrophy or other muscle disorder</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A type of weakness that occurs after a muscle group is used and lessens if the muscle group has some rest. That is, there is diminution of strength with repetitive muscle actions.

Comment:
This type of weakness is pathognomonic for an abnormality of the neuromuscular junction such as myasthenia gravis. A characteristic form of muscular weakness that worsens after use of affected muscles. Myasthenia is caused by  failure of neuromuscular transmission, which results from the binding of autoantibodies to proteins involved in signaling at the neuromuscular junction, including especially the nicotinic acetyl choline receptor (AChR) or, less frequently, a muscle-specific tyrosine kinase involved in AChR clustering.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002804" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A non-progressive finding characterized by multiple joint contractures found throughout the body at birth.

Comment:
Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is related to fetal akinesia owing to fetal neurogenic, muscle, or connective tissue disorders or occasionally to maternal conditions. AMC can be associated with polyhydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, micrognathia, ocular hypertelorism, and short umbilical cord. AMC is a feature of a heterogeneous group of disorders, some of which have the phrase &#39;arthrogryposis multiplex congenita&#39; as a part of their name (for instance, Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, distal type 1 or AMCD1). This term refers to the finding of multiple joint contractures found throughout the body at birth rather than to the disease entities of which this is a clinical feature.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.

Comment:
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.

Comment:
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.

Comment:
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.

Comment:
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001371" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Flexion contracture</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A flexion contracture is a bent (flexed) joint that cannot be straightened actively or passively. It is thus a chronic loss of joint motion due to structural changes in muscle, tendons, ligaments, or skin that prevents normal movement of joints.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003474" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sensory impairment</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of the primary sensation that is mediated by peripheral nerves (pain, temperature, touch, vibration, joint position). The word hypoesthesia (or hyesthesia) refers to a reduction in cutaneous sensation to a specific type of testing.

Comment:
This term does not include abnormalities of cortical sensation such as two-point discrimination, stereognosis, and graphesthesia.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011675" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Arrhythmia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Any cardiac rhythm other than the normal sinus rhythm. Such a rhythm may be either of sinus or ectopic origin and either regular or irregular. An arrhythmia may be due to a disturbance in impulse formation or conduction or both.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010546" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Muscle fibrillation</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Fine, rapid twitching of individual muscle fibers with little or no movement of the muscle as a whole. If a motor neuron or its axon is destroyed, the muscle fibers it innervates undergo denervation atrophy. This leads to hypersensitivity of individual muscle fibers to acetyl choline so that they may contract spontaneously. Isolated activity of individual muscle fibers is generally so fine it cannot be seen through the intact skin, although it can be recorded as a short-duration spike in the EMG.</p>
