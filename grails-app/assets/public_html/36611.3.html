  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Bilateral intracranial occlusive arteriopathy, with or without basal collaterals, confirmed by review by an expert neuroradiologist</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 No genes listed</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Hemorrhage into the parenchyma of the brain.

Comment:
A cerebral hemorrhage (or intracerebral hemorrhage, ICH), is a type of intracranial hemorrhage that occurs within the brain tissue itself.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002072" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Chorea</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Chorea (Greek for &#39;dance&#39;) refers to widespread arrhythmic involuntary movements of a forcible, jerky and restless fashion.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.

Comment:
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000957" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cafe-au-lait spot</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Cafe-au-lait spots are hyperpigmented lesions that can vary in color from light brown to dark brown with smooth borders and having a size of 1.5 cm or more in adults and 0.5 cm or more in children.

Comment:
The phrase cafe-au-lait comes from the French word for milk-coffee. A single cafe-au-lait spot can be an isolated finding in otherwise normal individuals. Multiple cafe-au-lait spots often indicate the presence of neurofibromatosis type 1 but may also be seen in other diseases including McCune-Albright syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Fanconi anemia.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001028" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hemangioma</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A hemangioma is a benign tumor characterized by blood-filled spaces lined by benign endothelial cells. A hemangioma characterized by large endothelial spaces (caverns) is called a cavernous hemangioma (in contrast to a hemangioma with small endothelial spaces, which is called capillary hemangioma).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000965" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cutis marmorata</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A reticular discoloration of the skin with cyanotic (reddish-blue appearing) areas surrounding pale central areas due to dilation of capillary blood vessels and stagnation of blood within the vessels. Cutis marmorata, also called livedo reticularis, generally occurs on the legs, arms and trunk and is often more severe in cold weather.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001999" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal facial shape</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormal morphology (form) of the face or its components.

Comment:
This term now covers many of the historical inexact descriptions such as Bird-like facies that probably should be avoided in modern genetics. This portion of the Ontology should be revised.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000822" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypertension</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The presence of chronic increased pressure in the systemic arterial system.

Comment:
Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic BP (140 mm Hg or higher), diastolic BP (90 mm Hg or higher), or both.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100817" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Renovascular hypertension</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The presence of hypertension related to stenosis of the renal artery.

Comment:
Renal artery stenosis can lead to hypertension and chronic kidney disease (due to chronic renal ischemia). The hypertension is caused by activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001679" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the aorta</a></h3>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing or constriction of a segment of the aorta.

Comment:
Coarctation refers to a narrowing of the lumen of a vessel producing an obstruction to flow. Coarctation can occur in any region of the aorta.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cataract</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.

Comment:
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).</p>
