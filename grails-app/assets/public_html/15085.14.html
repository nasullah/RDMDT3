						<!-- <h2>Severe multi-system atopic disease with high IgE eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
- All of the following are required:<br />
  - Adult patients only<br />
  - Onset of patients' medical problems is in early childhood (often < 1 year old)<br />
  - Severe persistent eczema (severe means requiring treatment over and above safe use of potent topical steroids, e.g. topical calcineurin inhibitors, UV light treatment or systemic immunosuppression: azathioprine, cyclosporine A, methotrexate, mycophenolate). Where topical calcineurin inhibitors are used as first line treatment and achieve good symptom control patients should only be included if serum IgE >10000.<br />
  - Recurrent or chronic S. aureus skin infections, but this criterion may be absent if the patient is receiving systemic immunosuppressive treatment.<br />
  - Asthma, but the severity can vary from mild to severe<br />
  - High IgE levels >5000<br />
  - Sensitised to a wide variety of aero-allergens and food allergens as measured by ImmunoCAP tests.

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
- Those with systemic infections (unlike patients with classical hyper IgE syndrome)

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
 

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000964" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Eczema</a></h3>
	Eczema is a form of dermatitis. The term eczema is broadly applied to a range of persistent skin conditions and can be related to a number of underlying conditions. Manifestations of eczema can include dryness and recurring skin rashes with redness, skin edema, itching and dryness, crusting, flaking, blistering, cracking, oozing, or bleeding.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003212" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Increased IgE level</a></h3>
	An abnormally increased level of immunoglobulin E in blood.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012393" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Allergy</a></h3>
	An allergy is an immune response or reaction to substances that are usually not harmful.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100327" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cow milk allergy</a></h3>
	Hypersensitivity in form of an adverse immune reaction against cow milk protein.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012395" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seasonal allergy</a></h3>
	An allergy experienced at a particular time of year when trees or grasses pollinate and elicit an allergic reaction.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003193" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Allergic rhinitis</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002257" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Chronic rhinitis</a></h3>
	Chronic inflammation of the nasal mucosa.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002099" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Asthma</a></h3>
	Asthma is characterized by increased responsiveness of the tracheobronchial tree to multiple stimuli, leading to narrowing of the air passages with resultant dyspnea, cough, and wheezing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005406" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent bacterial skin infections</a></h3>
	Increased susceptibility to bacterial infections of the skin, as manifested by recurrent episodes of infectious dermatitis.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Infectious dermatitis may manifest as impetigo, multiple purulent blisters, erythema, lymphadenopathy near the site of infection.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011371" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent viral skin infections</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011370" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent cutaneous fungal infections</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002718" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent bacterial infections</a></h3>
	Increased susceptibility to bacterial infections, as manifested by recurrent episodes of bacterial infection.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004429" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent viral infections</a></h3>
	Increased susceptibility to viral infections, as manifested by recurrent episodes of viral infection.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002841" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent fungal infections</a></h3>
	Increased susceptibility to fungal infections, as manifested by recurrent episodes of fungal infection.
