<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
- Low birth weight for gestation

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
 - PTPN11, RAF1, BRAF, SOS1, KRAS, HRAS, NRAS, SHOC2, CBL, SPRED1, MAP2K1, MAP2K2

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010880" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Increased nuchal translucency</a></h3>
	The presence of an abnormally large hypoechoic space in the posterior fetal neck (usually detected on prenatal ultrasound examination).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Increased nuchal translucency may be related to a cystic hygroma or to mesenchymal edema. Increased nuchal translucency can be classified into three categories: 1) cardiac abnormalities, combined with abnormal ductus venosus flow velocities, is found, leading to the theory that cardiac failure causes nuchal translucency enlargement; 2) various types of abnormalities are found in the extracellular matrix of the nuchal skin of fetuses with increased nuchal translucency; 3) abnormal lymphatic development is demonstrated in fetuses with increased nuchal translucency.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001790" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nonimmune hydrops fetalis</a></h3>
	A type of hydrops fetalis in which there is no identifiable circulating antibody to red blood cell antigens .
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001561" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Polyhydramnios</a></h3>
	The presence of excess amniotic fluid in the uterus during pregnancy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Polyhydramnios is diagnosed if the deepest vertical pool of amniotic fluid is more than 8 cm or amniotic fluid index is more than 95th percentile for the corresponding gestational age.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001531" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Failure to thrive in infancy</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011968" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Feeding difficulties</a></h3>
	Impaired ability to eat related to problems gathering food and getting ready to suck, chew, or swallow it.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001642" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pulmonic stenosis</a></h3>
	A narrowing of the right ventricular outflow tract that can occur at the pulmonary valve (valvular stenosis) or just below the pulmonary valve (infundibular stenosis).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Infundibular pulmonic stenosis is mostly caused by overgrowth of the heart muscle wall (hypertrophy of the septoparietal trabeculae). Pulmonic stenosis is often seen as a part of Fallot' s tetralogy, in which case the events leading to the formation of the overriding aorta are also believed to be a cause of the pulmonic stenosis. The pulmonic stenosis is the major cause of the malformations seen in patients with Fallot tetralogy, with the other associated malformations acting as compensatory mechanisms to the pulmonic stenosis. The degree of stenosis varies between individuals with TOF, and is the primary determinant of symptoms and severity. This malformation is infrequently described as sub-pulmonary stenosis or subpulmonary obstruction.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001639" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</a></h3>
	Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is defined by the presence of increased ventricular wall thickness or mass in the absence of loading conditions (hypertension, valve disease) sufficient to cause the observed abnormality.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001328" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Specific learning disability</a></h3>
	Impairment of certain skills such as reading or writing, coordination, self-control, or attention that interfere with the ability to learn. The impairment is not related to a global deficiency of intelligence.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term learning disability is used with different meanings in different contexts. Significant impairments of mental functioning with a reduction in IQ below 70 should be coded as mental retardation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002194" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Delayed gross motor development</a></h3>
	A type of motor delay characterized by an delay in acquiring the ability to control the large muscles of the body for walking, running, sitting, and crawling.

	Passing the age when puberty normally occurs with no physical or hormonal signs of the onset of puberty.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The age at which delayed puberty may be diagnosed in a person without signs of secondary sexual development is 13 years in a girl or 14 years in a boy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000028" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cryptorchidism</a></h3>
	Testis in inguinal canal. That is, absence of one or both testes from the scrotum owing to failure of the testis or testes to descend through the inguinal canal to the testis.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The gonad is mobile and can be retracted superiorly by the cremaster muscle reflex stimulated, for instance, by cold or touch. A retracted testis is not cryptorchidism. An abdominal testis cannot be distinguished by physical examination from an (Apparently) absent testis and requires radiological (or, rarely, surgical) procedures for assessment.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000957" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cafe-au-lait spot</a></h3>
	Cafe-au-lait spots are hyperpigmented lesions that can vary in color from light brown to dark brown with smooth borders and having a size of 1.5 cm or more in adults and 0.5 cm or more in children.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The phrase cafe-au-lait comes from the French word for milk-coffee. A single cafe-au-lait spot can be an isolated finding in otherwise normal individuals. Multiple cafe-au-lait spots often indicate the presence of neurofibromatosis type 1 but may also be seen in other diseases including McCune-Albright syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Fanconi anemia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001003" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Multiple lentigines</a></h3>

<br />
Comment:<br />
Lentigines are commonly (but not always) due to chronic sun exposure (solar lentigines; sometimes called liver spots) and occur most frequently on the face and back of the hands.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001028" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hemangioma</a></h3>
	A hemangioma is a benign tumor characterized by blood-filled spaces lined by benign endothelial cells. A hemangioma characterized by large endothelial spaces (caverns) is called a cavernous hemangioma (in contrast to a hemangioma with small endothelial spaces, which is called capillary hemangioma).

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001872" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of thrombocytes</a></h3>
	An abnormality of platelets.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Platelets, also known as thrombocytes, are non-nucleated disk-shaped cells mainly involved in blood coagulation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002664" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neoplasm</a></h3>
	An organ or organ-system abnormality that consists of uncontrolled autonomous cell-proliferation which can occur in any part of the body as a benign or malignant neoplasm (tumour).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies neoplasms into four main groups: (i) benign neoplasm, (ii) in situ neoplasm, (iii) malignant neoplasm, and (iv) neoplasm of uncertain or unknown behavior. A malignant neoplasm is also known as cancer.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002721" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Immunodeficiency</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000717" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Autism</a></h3>
	Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. Autism begins in childhood. It is marked by the presence of markedly abnormal or impaired development in social interaction and communication and a markedly restricted repertoire of activity and interest. Manifestations of the disorder vary greatly depending on the developmental level and chronological age of the individual (DSM-IV).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term refers to the diagnosis of autism and is left for convenience. However, it is preferable to annotate the exact phenotypic abnormalities rather than merely the diagnostic category autism.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000716" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Depression</a></h3>
	A condition characterized by pervasive dysphoric mood, loss of interests, and inability to experience pleasure.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100753" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Schizophrenia</a></h3>
	A mental disorder characterized by a disintegration of thought processes and of emotional responsiveness. It most commonly manifests as auditory hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions, or disorganized speech and thinking, and it is accompanied by significant social or occupational dysfunction. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in young adulthood, with a global lifetime prevalence of about 0.3-0.7%.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Positive symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations (especially of voices), are common, and any Schneiderian first-rank symptoms are particularly indicative of the illness. Negative symptoms include social withdrawal, impairment of ego boundaries, and loss of energy and initiative. Schizophrenia is diagnosed only if symptoms persist for at least one month. The illness can spontaneously remit, run a course with infrequent or frequent relapses, or become chronic. The prognosis has improved with antipsychotic drugs and with vigorous psychological and social management and rehabilitation. The many causes include genetic factors, environmental stress, and various triggering factors.
