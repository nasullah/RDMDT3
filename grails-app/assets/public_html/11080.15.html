  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Evidence of inborn error of metabolism as demonstrated by findings in at least 2 of the following areas:
  - Clinical presentation
  - Biochemical
  - Haematological
  - Radiological
- Biochemical testing and genetic testing completed for relevant known inborn errors of metabolism</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 - Genetic testing completed for relevant known inborn errors of metabolism</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>

The metabolic product, which causes vacuolation, depends on the specific enzyme deficiency.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.

Comment:
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001251" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ataxia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- oder overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly).

Comment:
Ataxia can be differentiated into dyssynergy, asynergy, dysmetria (hypometria, hypermetria), dysdiadochokinesis, gait ataxia, truncal ataxia, limb ataxia, and dysarthria). Note: This term does not include sensory ataxia.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001257" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Spasticity</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes with increased muscle tone, exaggerated (hyperexcitable) tendon reflexes.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002071" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of extrapyramidal motor function</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A neurological condition related to lesions of the basal ganglia leading to typical abnormalities including akinesia (inability to initiate changes in activity and perform volitional movements rapidly and easily), muscular rigidity (continuous contraction of muscles with constant resistance to passive movement), chorea (widespread arrhythmic movements of a forcible, rapid, jerky, and restless nature), athetosis (inability to sustain the muscles of the fingers, toes, or other group of muscles in a fixed position), and akathisia (inability to remain motionless).

Comment:
The basal ganglia, paired subcortical masses of grey matter that form distinct nuclei, subserve motor functions that are distinct from those of the pyramidal (i.e., corticospinal) tract. This is a bundled term that is kept for historical reasons, but it is preferable to annotate the precise abnormalities observed.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001290" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Generalized hypotonia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Generalized muscular hypotonia (abnormally low muscle tone).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002415" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Leukodystrophy</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Leukodystrophy refers to deterioration of white matter of the brain resulting from degeneration of myelin sheaths in the CNS. Their basic defect is directly related to the synthesis and maintenance of myelin membranes.

Comment:
The deterioration coincides with clinical regression of skills, and in the most severe cases neurological devastation. Leukodystrophy should be distinguished from leukoencephalopathy (defect causing secondary myelin damage). Note that the term leukodystrophy is most often used to refer to a disease rather than a phenotypic feature, and a more precise description is to be preferred if possible.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002134" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the basal ganglia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormality of the basal ganglia.

Comment:
The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei (striatum, pallidum substantia nigra, and the subthalamic nucleus) at the base of the forebrain that are connected to the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, and other areas. The basal ganglia subserve motor functions that are distinct from those of the pyramidal (corticospinal) tract, for which reason neurologic abnormalities caused by lesions to the basal ganglia are often referred to as extrapyramidal.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001789" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hydrops fetalis</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The abnormal accumulation of fluid in two or more fetal compartments, including ascites, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and skin edema.

Comment:
The most common causes of hydrops fetalis are hematologic (inclusing isoimmunization because of Rhesus incompatibility and other causes), hereditary hemolytic disorders, fetal hemorrhage, disorders of red cell production), cardiovascular disorders, infections, certain intrathoracic malformations, and idiopathic forms.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008064" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ichthyosis</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of the skin characterized the presence of excessive amounts of dry surface scales on the skin resulting from an abnormality of keratinization.

Comment:
The ichthyoses are a group of skin diseases characterized by drying and scaling of skin with the accumulation of thick scales and cracks that may be painful or bleed. The abnormality in ichthyosis lies in am imbalance in the normal lifecycle of skin in which growth is matched with dying and shedding of skin cells. In ichthyosis, skin cells reproduce at a rate faster than dead skin cells can be shed or reproduce at a normal rate with a reduction in the rate of shedding. Either abnormality leads to a build up of dry and scaly skin. Note that this term refers to the morphological abnormality of the skin and not the disorder.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000992" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cutaneous photosensitivity</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An increased sensitivity of the skin to light. Photosensitivity may result in a rash upon exposure to the sun (which is known as photodermatosis). Photosensitivity can be diagnosed by phototests in which light is shone on small areas of skin.</p>
