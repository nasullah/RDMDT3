  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Unexplained cerebellar ataxia progressing over &gt;2 years +/- spasticity, peripheral neuropathy, or bulbar dysfunction.

Individuals with syndromic disease or disease onset &lt;30 years should be recruited according to standard guidance, typically as trios. Disease status of apparently unaffected participants should be determined according to standard clinical practice to detect cryptic disease.  

In other cases, unaffected individuals should not be recruited. Recruitment in such families should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- No structural or inflammatory (MS-like) lesions on brain MRI.
- No history of alcohol excess.
- Normal thyroid function.
- No evidence of malignancy.</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing for genes which are affected by trinucleotide repeats is strongly recommended PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT as these will not be reliably detected by WGS using current analysis techniques including:

- Common trinucleotide repeat disorders excluded (ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, ATN1, FXN (only recessive history), FMR1</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001251" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ataxia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- oder overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly).

Comment:
Ataxia can be differentiated into dyssynergy, asynergy, dysmetria (hypometria, hypermetria), dysdiadochokinesis, gait ataxia, truncal ataxia, limb ataxia, and dysarthria). Note: This term does not include sensory ataxia.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Ophthalmoplegia is a paralysis or weakness of one or more of the muscles that control eye movement.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000570" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of saccadic eye movements</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of eye movement characterized by impairment of fast (saccadic) eye movements.

Comment:
Fast (saccadic) eye movements comprise voluntary or involuntary refixation movements, the fast phase of vestibular nystagmus, optokinetic nystagmus, and microsaccades.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000641" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dysmetric saccades</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The controller signal for saccadic eye movements has two components: the pulse that moves the eye rapidly from one point to the next, and the step that holds the eye in the new position. When both the pulse and the step are not the correct size, a dysmetric refixation eye movement results.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000514" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Slow saccadic eye movements</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormally slow velocity of the saccadic eye movements.

Comment:
Saccades are rapid eye movements that align the fovea with the target.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000639" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nystagmus</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Rhythmic, involuntary oscillations of one or both eyes related to abnormality in fixation, conjugate gaze, or vestibular mechanisms.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001347" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperreflexia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Hyperreflexia is the presence of hyperactive stretch reflexes of the muscles.

Comment:
Reflexes are graded according to the following scale: 0=absent; 1=present but diminished; 2=normoactive; 3=exaggerated; and 4=clonus. Clonus is always abnormal, and a grade 3 reflex may be abnormal if it is asymmetric or if it was previously grade 2 or less.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001284" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Areflexia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Absence of neurologic reflexes such as the knee-jerk reaction.

Comment:
The strectch reflexes (also called deep tendon relfexes) include the knee-jerk reflex (patellar reflex, the biceps reflex, the triceps reflex, and the ankle jerk reflex or Achilles tendon reflex).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003487" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Babinski sign</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Upturning of the big toe (and sometimes fanning of the other toes) in response to stimulation of the sole of the foot. If the Babinski sign is present it can indicate damage to the corticospinal tract.

Comment:
A positive Babinski sign can indicate damage to the corticospinal tract.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Functional neurological abnormalities related to dysfunction of the pyramidal tract.

Comment:
Presence of these signs can indicate affection of the corticospinal (pyramidal) tracts.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001257" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Spasticity</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes with increased muscle tone, exaggerated (hyperexcitable) tendon reflexes.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001324" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Muscle weakness</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Reduced strength of muscles.

Comment:
It is important clinical to distinguish between muscle weakness, fatigue, and asthenia. Fatigue describes the inability to continue performing a task after multiple repetitions; in contrast, a patient with primary weakness is unable to perform the first repetition of the task. Asthenia is a sense of weariness or exhaustion in the absence of muscle weakness. Conditions that result in intrinsic muscle weakness can be divided into several main categories: infectious, neurologic, endocrine, inflammatory, rheumatologic, genetic, metabolic, electrolyte-induced, or drug-induced.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002134" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the basal ganglia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormality of the basal ganglia.

Comment:
The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei (striatum, pallidum substantia nigra, and the subthalamic nucleus) at the base of the forebrain that are connected to the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, and other areas. The basal ganglia subserve motor functions that are distinct from those of the pyramidal (corticospinal) tract, for which reason neurologic abnormalities caused by lesions to the basal ganglia are often referred to as extrapyramidal.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002063" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Rigidity</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Continuous involuntary sustained muscle contraction. When an affected muscle is passively stretched, the degree of resistance remains constant regardless of the rate at which the muscle is stretched. This feature helps to distinguish rigidity from muscle spasticity.

Comment:
Rigidity is often a manifestation of basal ganglia diseases.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002322" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Resting tremor</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A resting tremor occurs when muscles are at rest and becomes less noticeable or disappears when the affected muscles are moved. Resting tremors are often slow and coarse.</p>
