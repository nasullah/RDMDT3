  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Cerebellar or ponto-cerebellar hypoplasia on MRI brain scan</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Findings characteristic of Joubert syndrome (in which case recruit to Joubert syndrome category)
•	Known genetic cause
•	Evidence of causative prenatal infection such as CMV (this usually causes more widespread brain abnormalities such as calcification not just cerebellar hypoplasia)</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 -	Gene panel including ITPR1, SPTBN2, KCNC3, CASK, OPHN1</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A degree of language development that is significantly below the norm for a child of a specified age.

Comment:
Language delay can be characterized by a failure to meet the developmental milestones for language development, an inability to follow directions, or slow or incomprehensible speech after the age of three years, as well as with severe problems with syntax or articulation.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.

Comment:
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term &#39;psychomotor retardation&#39; is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.

Comment:
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.

Comment:
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000256" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Macrocephaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Occipitofrontal (head) circumference greater than 97th centile compared to appropriate, age matched, sex-matched normal standards. Alternatively, a apparently increased size of the cranium.

Comment:
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far above the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Macrocephaly is an absolute term. The term relative macrocephaly can be used when the head size centile exceeds the centile for height, for example, head size at the 75th centile with height at the 5th centile for age and sex.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001251" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ataxia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- oder overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly).

Comment:
Ataxia can be differentiated into dyssynergy, asynergy, dysmetria (hypometria, hypermetria), dysdiadochokinesis, gait ataxia, truncal ataxia, limb ataxia, and dysarthria). Note: This term does not include sensory ataxia.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001272" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebellar atrophy</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Atrophy (wasting) of the cerebellum.

Comment:
Cerebellar atrophy can be diagnosed if the cerebellum is small with shrunken folia and large cerebellar fissures or if it has been shown to undergo progressive volume loss.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001305" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dandy-Walker malformation</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A congenital brain malformation typically characterized by incomplete formation of the cerebellar vermis, dilation of the fourth ventricle, and enlargement of the posterior fossa. In layman&#39;s terms, Dandy Walker malformation is a cyst in the cerebellum (typically symmetrical) that is involved with the fourth ventricle. This may interfere with the ability to drain cerebrospinal fluid from the brain, resulting in hydrocephalus. Dandy Walker cysts are formed during early embryonic development, while the brain forms. The cyst in the cerebellum typically has several blood vessels running through it connecting to the brain, thereby prohibiting surgical removal.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001321" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebellar hypoplasia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Underdevelopment of the cerebellum.

Comment:
By prenatal ultrasound, cerebellar hypoplasia is diagnosed if the cerebellum measures more than two standard deviations below the mean. In adults, cerebellar hypoplasia is typically diagnosed by computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebellar hypoplasia can be diagnosed if there is a small cerebellum with fissures of normal size compared with the folia (this is a distinguishing characteristic compared with cerebellar atrophy).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012642" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebellar agenesis</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Lack of development of the cerebellum.

Comment:
Usually, small remnants of the cerebellum are present; therefore the term subtotal cerebellar agenesis is also used in the literature.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002419" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Molar tooth sign on MRI</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormal appearance of the midbrain in axial magnetic resonance imaging in which the elongated superior cerebellar peduncles give the midbrain an appearance reminiscent of a molar or wisdom tooth.

Comment:
Molar tooth appearance results from a lack of normal decussation of superior cerebellar peduncular fiber tracts which in turn leads to enlargement of the peduncles, which also follow a more horizontal course. The absence of crossing fibers also leads to a reduction in the anteroposterior diameter of the midbrain and deepening of the interpeduncular cistern.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of the cerebral white matter.

Comment:
This finding can be demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging, especially with t2 signalling. The cerebral white matter is the region of the central nervous system that  consists mostly of glial cells and myelinated axons that interconnect the various regions of the cerebrum and the lower brain centers. It is located in the subcortex.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002134" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the basal ganglia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormality of the basal ganglia.

Comment:
The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei (striatum, pallidum substantia nigra, and the subthalamic nucleus) at the base of the forebrain that are connected to the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, and other areas. The basal ganglia subserve motor functions that are distinct from those of the pyramidal (corticospinal) tract, for which reason neurologic abnormalities caused by lesions to the basal ganglia are often referred to as extrapyramidal.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.

Comment:
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.</p>
