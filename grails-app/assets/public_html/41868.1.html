  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Congenital anorectal malformation regardless of phenotype severity (imperforate anus through to cloaca) 
AND
At least one first or second degree relative with an anorectal malformation.

Disease status of apparently unaffected participants should be determined according to standard clinical practice to detect cryptic disease.

Unaffected individuals should not be recruited. Recruitment in such families should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Additional clinical features suggestive of a multisystem syndrome other than VACTERL association.
For example, please do not recruit cases with clinical diagnoses of Currarino syndrome, Townes-Brockes syndrome or Pallister-Hall syndrome.</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice: 
 No genes specified</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Obstruction of the intestine due to abnormally thick meconium.

Comment:
Obstruction of the intestine is known as ileus.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Constipation for longer than three months with fewer than 3 bowel movements per week, straining, lumpy or hard stools, and a sensation of anorectal obstruction or incomplete defecation.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002607" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Bowel incontinence</a></h3>

Urinary incontinence can be defined as the complaint of any involuntary leakage of urine.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012032" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Lipoma</a></h3>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002144" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Tethered cord</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">During normal embryological development, the spinal cord first occupies the entire length of the vertebral column but goes on to assume a position at the level of L1 due to differential growth of the conus medullaris and the vertebral column. The filum terminale is a slender, threadlike structure that remains after the normal regression of the distal embryonic spinal cord and attaches the spinal cord to the coccyx. A tethered cord results if there is a thickened rope-like filum terminale which anchors the cord at the level of L2 or below, potentially causing neurologic signs owing to abnormal tension on the spinal cord.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002475" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Myelomeningocele</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Protrusion of the meninges and portions of the spinal cord through a defect of the vertebral column.

Comment:
Meningomyelocele can result if more than one or two vertebral bodies are affected by spina bifida. The meningomyelocele is usually covered by a thin, vulnerable membrane. Meningomyelocele is generally accompanied by neurological deficits.</p>

Comment:
This term now covers many of the historical inexact descriptions such as Bird-like facies that probably should be avoided in modern genetics. This portion of the Ontology should be revised.</p>
