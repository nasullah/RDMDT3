  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Electrographically-proven generalised epilepsy
- At least two first degree relatives or affected family members across three generations who have generalised epilepsy
- All forms of generalised epilepsy are permissible</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Suspected acquired cause of epilepsy
- Focal neurological deficit
- MRI demonstrates structural substrate for epilepsy
- EEG demonstrates definite focal discharges</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002373" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Febrile seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Febrile seizures are convulsions induced by a fever in infants or small children and are generally characterized by loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic movements. Most febrile seizures last a minute or two.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002069" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Generalized tonic-clonic seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Generalized tonic-clonic seizures are generalized seizures with bilateral symmetrical tonic contraction then bilateral clonic contractions of somatic muscles usually associated with autonomic phenomena.

Comment:
In a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, the patient suddenly loses conciousness, the eyes roll back, and the entire body musculature undergoes tonic contractions. In the clonic phase of the seizure, there are rhythmic contractions of the musculature alternating with relaxation of all muscle groups. Loss of sphincter control during the seizure is common. This form of seizure was formerly commonly called grand mal seizure.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Typical absences are brief for seconds generalized epileptic seizures of abrupt onset and abrupt termination with impairment of consciousness.

Comment:
Typical absences have 2 essential components: (1) clinically the impairment of consciousness (absence), and (2) EEG generalized 3 Hz to 4 Hz (less than 2.5 Hz) spike and slow wave discharges.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Generalized seizures with sustained increase in muscle contraction lasting a few seconds to minutes.

Comment:
Characterized by a sudden increase in muscle tone whereby the body, arms, or legs make sudden stiffening movements and consciousness is usually preserved. Tonic seizures can occur during sleep. Tonic seizures usually affect both sides of the body, and cause a fall if the affected person was standing when the seizure started.</p>

Comment:
Spikes (&lt;70 ms) and sharp waves (70-200 ms) are sharp transient waves that have a strong association with epilepsy. No difference is noted in terms of clinical significance of spikes and sharp waves. Significant spikes usually are followed by a slow wave.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">EEG abnormalities (epileptiform discharges) evoked by flashing lights or black and white striped patterns.

Comment:
In some patients, seizures can be provoked by specific external factors (reflex epilepsy), including flickering lights and patterns. These patients commonly show epileptiform discharges in the EEG when stimulated with flashing lights, black and white striped patterns and television. These evoked EEG abnormalities are called photoparoxysmal responses.</p>
