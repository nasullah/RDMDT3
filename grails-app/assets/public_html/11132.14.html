	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008208" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Parathyroid hyperplasia</a></h3>
	Hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
An absolute increase in the mass of the parenchymal cells of the parathyroid gland leading to an enlargement of the parathyroid glands.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002865" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Medullary thyroid carcinoma</a></h3>
	The presence of a medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002893" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pituitary adenoma</a></h3>
	A benign epithelial tumor derived from intrinsic cells of the adenohypophysis.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
In most cases pituitary adenoma are histologically benign, slow-growing, small neoplasms confined to the sella turcica. Some pituitary adenomas are more aggressive, grow faster, invade surrounding tissues, and cause local symptoms such as visual disturbances, headache, and varying degrees of hypopituitarism.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008256" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Adrenocortical adenoma</a></h3>
	Adrenocortical adenomas are benign tumors of the adrenal cortex.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006744" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Adrenocortical carcinoma</a></h3>
	A malignant neoplasm of the adrenal cortex that may produce hormones such as cortisol, aldosterone, estrogen, or testosterone.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100634" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neuroendocrine neoplasm</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100570" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Carcinoid</a></h3>
	A tumor formed from the endocrine (argentaffin) cells of the mucosal lining of a variety of organs including the stomach and intestine. These cells are from neuroectodermal origin.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002666" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pheochromocytoma</a></h3>
	Pheochromocytomas (also known as chromaffin tumors) produce, store, and secrete catecholamines. Pheochromocytomas usually originate from the adrenal medulla but may also develop from chromaffin cells in or about sympathetic ganglia. A common symptom of pheochromocytoma is hypertension owing to release of catecholamines.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002668" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Paraganglioma</a></h3>
	A carotid body tumor (also called paraganglionoma or chemodectoma) is a tumor found in the upper neck at the branching of the carotid artery. They arise from the chemoreceptor organ (paraganglion) located in the adventitia of the carotid artery bifurcation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005994" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nodular goiter</a></h3>
	Enlargement of the thyroid gland related to one or more nodules in the thyroid gland.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000845" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Growth hormone excess</a></h3>
	Acromegaly is a condition resulting from overproduction of growth hormone by the pituitary gland in persons with closed epiphyses, and consists chiefly in the enlargement of the distal parts of the body. The circumference of the skull increases, the nose becomes broad, the tongue becomes enlarged, the facial features become coarsened, the mandible grows excessively, and the teeth become separated. The fingers and toes grow chiefly in thickness.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Disorder resulting from excess pituitary gland production of growth hormone (hGH).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001943" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypoglycemia</a></h3>
	A decreased concentration of glucose in the blood.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000843" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperparathyroidism</a></h3>
	Excessive production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by the parathyroid glands.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002897" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Parathyroid adenoma</a></h3>
	A benign tumor of the parathyroid gland that can cause hyperparathyroidism.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003072" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypercalcemia</a></h3>
	An abnormally increased calcium concentration in the blood.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003528" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Elevated calcitonin</a></h3>
	Calcitonin is a 32-amino acid polypeptide hormone that is produced primarily by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid. It acts to reduce blood calcium (Ca2+), opposing the effects of parathyroid hormone.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012197" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Insulinoma</a></h3>
	A type of tumor of the pancreatic beta cells that secretes excess insulin and can result in hypoglycemia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002044" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Zollinger-Ellison syndrome</a></h3>
	A condition in which there is increased production of gastrin by a gastrin-secreting tumor (usually located in the pancreas, duodenum, or abdominal lymph nodes) that stimulates the gastric mucosa to maximal activity, with consequent gastrointestinal mucosal ulceration.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may occur as a manifestation of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000179" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Thick lower lip vermilion</a></h3>
	Increased thickness of the lower lip, leading to a prominent appearance of the lower lip. The height of the vermilion of the lower lip in the midline is more than 2 SD above the mean. Alternatively, an apparently increased height of the vermilion of the lower lip in the frontal view (subjective).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Normal values for the height of the vermilion are available [Farkas, 1981] but measurements are not commonly used. Most clinicians determine this feature subjectively. The lower lip is typically thicker than the upper one. The height of the vermilion of the lower lip varies among ethnic groups, and the vermilion should<br />
be compared to a population of same ethnic background. When the vermilion is thick, it is more convex and more everted than usual on profile view, but that should be assessed separately.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003005" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ganglioneuroma</a></h3>
	A benign neoplasm that usually arises from the sympathetic trunk in the mediastinum, representing a tumor of the sympathetic nerve fibers arising from neural crest cells.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Ganglioneuromas and ganglioneuroblastomas are tumors of the sympathetic nervous system. They originate from neural crest sympathogonia, which are completely undifferentiated cells of the sympathetic nervous system.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000574" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Thick eyebrow</a></h3>
	Increased density/number and/or increased diameter of eyebrow hairs.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Thickness can be regional (medial, middle/central, lateral) or total.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001031" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Subcutaneous lipoma</a></h3>
	The presence of subcutaneous lipoma.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000957" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cafe-au-lait spot</a></h3>
	Cafe-au-lait spots are hyperpigmented lesions that can vary in color from light brown to dark brown with smooth borders and having a size of 1.5 cm or more in adults and 0.5 cm or more in children.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The phrase cafe-au-lait comes from the French word for milk-coffee. A single cafe-au-lait spot can be an isolated finding in otherwise normal individuals. Multiple cafe-au-lait spots often indicate the presence of neurofibromatosis type 1 but may also be seen in other diseases including McCune-Albright syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Fanconi anemia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002751" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Kyphoscoliosis</a></h3>
	An abnormal curvature of the spine in both a coronal (lateral) and sagittal (back-to-front) plane.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000767" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pectus excavatum</a></h3>
	A defect of the chest wall characterized by a depression of the sternum, giving the chest ("pectus") a caved-in ("excavatum") appearance.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000218" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">High palate</a></h3>
	Height of the palate more than 2 SD above the mean (objective) or palatal height at the level of the first permanent molar more than twice the height of the teeth (subjective).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The measuring device for this assessment is described in (Hall JG, Froster-Iskenius UG, Allanson JE, Gripp K, Slavotinek A. 2006. Handbook of Normal Physical Measurements. 2nd edition. Oxford Medical, publishers). A high palate is often associated with a narrow palate. However, a narrow palate can easily give a false appearance of a high palate. Height and width of the palate should be assessed and coded separately. We do not recommend the subjective determination because this term can be overused and<br />
applied inaccurately.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001519" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Disproportionate tall stature</a></h3>
	A tall and slim body build with increased arm span to height ratio (>1.05) and a reduced upper-to-lower segment ratio (<0.85), i.e., unusually long arms and legs. The extremities as well as the hands and feet are unusually slim.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010726" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Prominent corneal nerve fibers</a></h3>
	Abnormal prominence of the corneal nerve fibers.
