						<!-- <h2>Juvenile dermatomyositis eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
- Any child/young person aged 18 years or younger that has been diagnosed with one of the following:<br />
  - Definite/probable juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM)<br />
  - Definite/probable polymyositis<br />
  - JDM or polymyositis overlap with scleroderma, chronic polyarthritis, mixed connective tissue disease or systemic lupus erythematosus<br />
  - Mixed connective tissue disease<br />
  - Other idiopathic inflammatory myopathy<br />
- Focus will be in specific endo-phenotypes (e.g. calcinosis, lipodystrophy)

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
- Entry into another registry<br />
- Children diagnosed with other types of myositis (e.g. septic myositis of infectious cause)

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
 

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001945" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Fever</a></h3>
	Elevated body temperature due to failed thermoregulation.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hyperthermia is defined as a temperature greater than 37.5-38.3 ??C (100-101 ??F).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001324" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Muscle weakness</a></h3>
	Reduced strength of muscles.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
It is important clinical to distinguish between muscle weakness, fatigue, and asthenia. Fatigue describes the inability to continue performing a task after multiple repetitions; in contrast, a patient with primary weakness is unable to perform the first repetition of the task. Asthenia is a sense of weariness or exhaustion in the absence of muscle weakness. Conditions that result in intrinsic muscle weakness can be divided into several main categories: infectious, neurologic, endocrine, inflammatory, rheumatologic, genetic, metabolic, electrolyte-induced, or drug-induced.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003324" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Generalized muscle weakness</a></h3>
	Generalized weakness or decreased strength of the muscles, affecting both distal and proximal musculature.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003701" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Proximal muscle weakness</a></h3>
	A lack of strength of the proximal muscles.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Removed logical definition that used anonymous class. Outstanding term request in UBERON for proximal muscle organ.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100614" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Myositis</a></h3>
	A general term for inflammation of the muscles without respect to the underlying cause.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Many such conditions are considered likely to be caused by autoimmune conditions, rather than directly due to infection, although autoimmune conditions can be activated or exacerbated by infections. It is also a documented side effect of the lipid-lowering drugs such as statins and fibrates. Elevation of creatine kinase in blood is indicative of myositis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003458" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: myopathic abnormalities</a></h3>
	The presence of abnormal electromyographic patterns indicative of myopathy, such as small-short polyphasic motor unit potentials.

	A flexion contracture is a bent (flexed) joint that cannot be straightened actively or passively. It is thus a chronic loss of joint motion due to structural changes in muscle, tendons, ligaments, or skin that prevents normal movement of joints.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000988" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Skin rash</a></h3>

<br />
Comment:<br />
Edema may be related to one or more of the following factors: 1) increased capillary hydrostatic pressure, 2) decreased osmotic pressure of plasma, 3) decreased tissue tension and lymphatic drainage, 4) increased osmotic pressure of tissue fluids, and 5) increased capillary permeability.
