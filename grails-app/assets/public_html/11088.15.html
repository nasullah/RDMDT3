  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Dystonia affecting any body part, usually spreading to involve multiple body regions (e.g. multifocal, segmental, generalised)
- Age at onset &lt;31 years or later onset with family history of early onset dystonia
- May be paroxysmal/episodic dystonia
- May be associated with myoclonus as in myoclonic dystonia

This disease category includes dopa responsive dystonia.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Underlying cause for clinical syndrome identified, e.g. cerebral palsy, dopa-responsive dystonia, structural brain lesion, Wilson disease, psychogenic dystonia</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 - TOR1A</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000473" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Torticollis</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Involuntary contractions of the neck musculature resulting in an abnormal posture of or abnormal movements of the head.

Comment:
The word torticollis comes from Latin words meaning twisted neck. Spasmodic torticollis is a focal dystonia that affects the neck and sometimes the shoulders, leading to involuntary contractions of the neck muscles, abnormal movements and postures of the head and neck. The abnormal movements can have both tonic and clonic components and can results in pain and discomfort. Spasmodic torticollis is the most common focal dystonia.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Atrophy of the optic nerve. Optic atrophy results from the death of the retinal ganglion cell axons that comprise the optic nerve and manifesting as a pale optic nerve on fundoscopy.

Comment:
The diagnosis of optic atrophy is made when the optic disc loses its normal orange-pink color. Optic atrophy is an end stage that arises from myriad causes of optic nerve damage anywhere along the path from the retina to the lateral geniculate. Some of the most common etiologies are advanced glaucoma, optic neuritis, arteritic or non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy or a compressive lesion.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- oder overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly).

Comment:
Ataxia can be differentiated into dyssynergy, asynergy, dysmetria (hypometria, hypermetria), dysdiadochokinesis, gait ataxia, truncal ataxia, limb ataxia, and dysarthria). Note: This term does not include sensory ataxia.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001257" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Spasticity</a></h3>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.

Comment:
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.

Comment:
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003474" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sensory impairment</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of the primary sensation that is mediated by peripheral nerves (pain, temperature, touch, vibration, joint position). The word hypoesthesia (or hyesthesia) refers to a reduction in cutaneous sensation to a specific type of testing.

Comment:
This term does not include abnormalities of cortical sensation such as two-point discrimination, stereognosis, and graphesthesia.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009830" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Peripheral neuropathy</a></h3>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormality of the basal ganglia.

Comment:
The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei (striatum, pallidum substantia nigra, and the subthalamic nucleus) at the base of the forebrain that are connected to the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, and other areas. The basal ganglia subserve motor functions that are distinct from those of the pyramidal (corticospinal) tract, for which reason neurologic abnormalities caused by lesions to the basal ganglia are often referred to as extrapyramidal.</p>

Comment:
Atrophy may be progressive over time.</p>

Comment:
Cerebellar atrophy can be diagnosed if the cerebellum is small with shrunken folia and large cerebellar fissures or if it has been shown to undergo progressive volume loss.</p>
