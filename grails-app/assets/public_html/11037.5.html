						<!-- <h2>Erythropoietic protoporphyria, mild variant Eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- History of episodic photosensitivity;<br />
- No evidence of an alternative cause of photosensitivity;<br />
- Onset of symptoms >60 mins after sun exposure and/or atypical symptoms compared to classical EPP photosensitivity and/or resolution of symptoms <48 hours<br />
- Raised red cell free protoporphyrin concentration

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Normal red cell protoporphyrin concentration

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
- FECH

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

						<!-- <h2>Erythropoietic protoporphyria Phenotypes</h2> -->

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001080" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Biliary tract abnormality</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the biliary tree.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001081" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cholelithiasis</a></h3>
	Hard, pebble-like deposits that form within the gallbladder.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Gallstones range in size from as small as a grain of sand to as large as a golf ball. Cholesterol gallstones are the most common type of gallstone. Gallstones resulting from too much bilirubin in the bile are referred to as pigment stones.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001399" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hepatic failure</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001396" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cholestasis</a></h3>
	Impairment of bile flow due to obstruction in bile ducts.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000992" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cutaneous photosensitivity</a></h3>
	An increased sensitivity of the skin to light. Photosensitivity may result in a rash upon exposure to the sun (which is known as photodermatosis). Photosensitivity can be diagnosed by phototests in which light is shone on small areas of skin.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000982" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Palmoplantar keratoderma</a></h3>
	Abnormal thickening of the skin of the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000969" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Edema</a></h3>
	An abnormal accumulation of fluid beneath the skin, or in one or more cavities of the body.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Edema may be related to one or more of the following factors: 1) increased capillary hydrostatic pressure, 2) decreased osmotic pressure of plasma, 3) decreased tissue tension and lymphatic drainage, 4) increased osmotic pressure of tissue fluids, and 5) increased capillary permeability.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001935" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcytic anemia</a></h3>
	A kind of anemia in which the volume of the red blood cells is reduced.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
In normocytic anemia, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is below normal limits (>80 fl in adults).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001394" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cirrhosis</a></h3>
	A chronic disorder of the liver in which liver tissue becomes scarred and is partially replaced by regenerative nodules and fibrotic tissue resulting in loss of liver function.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Cirrhosis is caused by chronic liver disease as a result of viral infections (hepatitis), alcohol abuse, certain medications, certain metabolic disorders of iron and copper, and many others. Cirrhosis may lead to a number of abnormalities including hepatomegaly, jaundice, abnormal liver function tests, ascites, dilatation of veins in the abdominal wall, anemia, and clotting deficiencies.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002910" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Elevated hepatic transaminases</a></h3>
	Elevations of the levels of SGOT and SGPT in the serum. SGOT (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase) and SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase) are transaminases primarily found in the liver and heart and are released into the bloodstream as the result of liver or heart damage. SGOT and SGPT are used clinically mainly as markers of liver damage.
