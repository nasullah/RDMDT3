						<!-- <h2>Primary Microcephaly - Microcephalic Dwarfism Spectrum Phenotypes</h2> -->

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001256" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability, mild</a></h3>
	Mild intellectual disability is defined as an intelligence quotient (IQ) in the range of 50-69.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002342" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability, moderate</a></h3>
	Moderate mental retardation is defined as an intelligence quotient (IQ) in the range of 35-49.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010864" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability, severe</a></h3>
	Severe mental retardation is defined as an intelligence quotient (IQ) in the range of 20-34.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Persons with severe mental retardation can be taught basic life skills and simple tasks with supervision.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006498" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the patella</a></h3>
	Absence or underdevelopment of the patella.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003065" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Patellar hypoplasia</a></h3>
	Underdevelopment of the patella.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006443" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Patellar aplasia</a></h3>
	Absence of the patella.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008551" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microtia</a></h3>
	Underdevelopment of the external ear.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The definitions of microtia follow a widely used, surgically based, classification of ear anomalies outlined by Weerda 1988. As microtia indicates at least both decreased length and width, and in more severe forms it includes abnormal shape of structures, all forms are acknowledged to be bundled terms, but are retained here because they are well established.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005484" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Postnatal microcephaly</a></h3>
	Microcephaly (HP:0000252) with onset in the postnatal period, that is, the head circumference is in the normal range at birth but falls behind normal values later in development.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000253" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Progressive microcephaly</a></h3>
	Progressive microcephaly is diagnosed when the head circumference falls progressively behind age- and gender-dependent norms.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011451" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Congenital microcephaly</a></h3>
	Microcephaly (HP:0000252) that is present already at the time of birth.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003508" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Proportionate short stature</a></h3>
	A kind of short stature in which different regions of the body are shortened to a comparable extent.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Small for gestational age</a></h3>
	Smaller than normal size according to sex and gestational age related norms, defined as a weight below the 10th percentile for the gestational age.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001511" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intrauterine growth retardation</a></h3>
	An abnormal restriction of fetal growth with fetal weight below the tenth percentile for gestational age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Intrauterine growth restriction is a newer term that is preferred over Intrauterine growth retardation. The causes of IUGR include maternal abnormalities (chronic hypertension, cyanotic heart disease, smoking, drug abuse), placental or umbilical cord abnormalities (including placenta previa and cord anomalies), maternal medicationas, and genetic disorders of the fetus.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011438" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Maternal teratogenic exposure</a></h3>
	A medical history of exposure of the mother of a child or fetus to a teratogenic substance during pregnancy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Commonly encountered maternal teratogens include alcohol, antiepileptic drugs, antihypertensive and antithyroid medications, aspirin, bisphosphonates, chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, ionizing radiation, recreational drugs, and serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (a class of antidepressants).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000819" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Diabetes mellitus</a></h3>
	A group of abnormalities characterized by hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001595" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the hair</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the hair.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001876" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pancytopenia</a></h3>
	An abnormal reduction in numbers of all blood cell types (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002719" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent infections</a></h3>
	Increased susceptibility to microbial infections, as manifested by recurrent episodes of infection.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
	Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004322" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short stature</a></h3>
	A height below that which is expected according to age and gender norms. Although there is no universally accepted definition of short stature, many refer to "short stature" as height more than 2 standard deviations below the mean for age and gender (or below the 3rd percentile for age and gender dependent norms).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.
