						<!-- <h2>Renal tubular acidosis Eligibility</h2> -->
Relevant diseases:<br />
- Distal renal tubular acidosis<br />
- Renal Fanconi syndrome<br />
- Gitelman and Bartter type 3 syndrome (Hypokalaemic alkalosis with hypomagnesaemia & hypocalcalciuria)<br />
- Bartter syndrome type 1, 2 & 4 (Hypokalaemic alkalosis with hypercalciuria)<br />
- Liddle syndrome (hypertensive hypokalaemic alkalosis)<br />
- Gordon syndrome (hypertensive hyperkalaemic acidosis)<br />
- Glucocorticoid remediable hypertension<br />
- Apparent Mineralocorticoid excess<br />
- Pseudohypoaldosteronism type1

<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
- Renal acid-base or other electrolyte disorders of unknown aetiology.<br />
AND<br />
- Unaffected individuals have undergone appropriate screening for cryptic disease<br />
- Individuals with severe or syndromic disease should be recruited according to standard guidance, preferably as trios<br />
- In other cases, unaffected individuals should not be recruited. Recruitment in such families should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs.

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Prior genetic testing that identifies a pathogenic mutation in a gene known to cause one or more of the diseases detailed above.

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
- Distal renal tubular acidosis: SLC4A1, ATP6V0A4, ATP6V1B1<br />
  - Hypokalaemic alkalosis with hypomagnesaemia & hypocalciuria: SLC12A3, CLCNKB<br />
  - Hypokalaemic alkalosis with hypercalciuria: SLC12A1, KCNJ1, BSND

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000124" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Renal tubular dysfunction</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001947" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Renal tubular acidosis</a></h3>
	Acidosis owing to malfunction of the kidney tubules with accumulation of metabolic acids and hyperchloremia, potentially leading to complications including hypokalemia, hypercalcinuria, nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011038" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of renal resorption</a></h3>
	An abnormality of renal absorption.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011036" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of renal excretion</a></h3>
	An altered ability of the kidneys to void urine and/or specific substances.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000121" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nephrocalcinosis</a></h3>
	Nephrocalcinosis is the deposition of calcium salts in renal parenchyma.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Nephrocalcinosis can be intratubular or interstitial, and can be diagnosed by means of a radiologic exam (plain radiographs, ultrasonograms, or computed tomography scans) or via microscopic examination of the renal tissues. The term nephrocalcinosis most often applies to a generalized increase in renal calcium content.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000787" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nephrolithiasis</a></h3>
	The presence of calculi (stones) in the kidneys.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Urinary stone disease is caused by supersaturation of the urine by stone forming substances including calcium, oxalate, and uric acid. Crystals or foreign bodies can act as a nidus for further stone formation. THe resulting kidney stones (calculi) lead to symptoms if they become impacted in the ureter.
