						<!-- <h2>Apparent aplastic anaemia or paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
Aplastic anaemia<br />
•	Bi-cytopenia or pancytopenia: at least 2 of 3 following: Hb <10g/dl, platelet count < 50 x 109/l, neutrophil count < 1.5 x 109/l, AND<br />
•	Hypocellular bone marrow biopsy, AND<br />
•	Normal MMC/DEB-induced  (Fanconi anaemia)chromosome breakage result, AND<br />
•	All cases must be discussed and approved by the aplastic anaemia/myeloid MDT at the recruiting GMC<br />
<br />
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH)<br />
•	Presence of PNH clone by flow cytometry, AND<br />
•	All cases must be discussed and approved by the PNH/aplastic anaemia/myeloid MDT at the recruiting GMC

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
Aplastic anaemia<br />
•	Abnormal infiltrate or fibrosis in bone marrow<br />
•	B12 or folate deficiency<br />
•	Known genetic cause already identified in proband or family member<br />
<br />
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria<br />
•	Absence of PNH clone by flow cytometry

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
 -	Consideration of DKC1, PIGA, TERC, TERT, SBDS

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001876" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pancytopenia</a></h3>
	An abnormal reduction in numbers of all blood cell types (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001903" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anemia</a></h3>
	A reduction in erythrocytes volume or hemoglobin concentration.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Anemia is not a specific entity but can result from many underlying pathologic processes. The three main causes of anemia are blood loss, decreased or faulty red blood cell production, and increased destruction of red blood cells. Various classifications are in clinical use including a classification according to the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the erythrocytes: microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic. Anemias can also be classified according to variations in cell size and shape, as reflected by the red-cell distribution width (RDW). Additionally, anemias can be classified into those of inadequate production and hemolytic anemias.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001875" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neutropenia</a></h3>
	An abnormally low number of neutrophils in the peripheral blood.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Mild neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil cont between 1000 and 1500 cells per microliter, moderte as between 500 and 100, and severe as less than 500 cells.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001873" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Thrombocytopenia</a></h3>
	A reduction in the number of circulating thrombocytes.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Thrombocytopenia can be divided into three major causes; 1) low production of platelets in the bone marrow; 2) intravascular breakdown of thrombocytes; and 3) increased turnover of platelets in spleen or liver (extravascular).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001878" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hemolytic anemia</a></h3>
	A type of anemia caused by premature destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Normally, erythrocytes survive on average about 110-120 days. With hemolysis, the erythrocyte survival is shortened, and generally increased marrow activity results in a reticulocyte count.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004420" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Arterial thrombosis</a></h3>
	The formation of a blood clot inside an artery.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004936" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Venous thrombosis</a></h3>
	Formation of a blood clot (thrombus) inside a vein, causing the obstruction of blood flow.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005305" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebral venous thrombosis</a></h3>
	Formation of a blood clot (thrombus) inside a cerebral vein, causing the obstruction of blood flow.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030248" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Mesenteric venous thrombosis</a></h3>
	A clot that obstructs blood flow in a mesenteric vein (the superior and the inferior mesenteric vein drain blood from the small and large intestine).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Mesenteric venous thrombosis may be associated with abdominal pain and bloating, diarrhea, fever, gastrointestinal bleeding, and vomiting
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002639" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Budd-Chiari syndrome</a></h3>
	Budd–Chiari syndrome (BCS) is caused by obstruction of hepatic venous outflow at any level from the small hepatic veins to the junction of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with the right atrium,1 and occurs in 1/100,000 of the general population worldwide. The most common presentation is with ascites, but can range from fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) to asymptomatic forms. Obstruction of hepatic venous outflow is mainly caused by primary intravascular thrombosis, which can occur suddenly or be repeated over time, accompanied by some revascularization, accounting for the variable parenchymal hepatic damage and histologic presentation. Budd-Chiari syndrome is thus a disease, but since it occurs as a manifestation of several other diseases, this term is kept for the present for convenience.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030242" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Portal vein thrombosis</a></h3>
	Thrombosis of the portal vein and/or its tributaries, which include the splenic vein and the sup-erior and inferior mesenteric veins.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) can occur within the main portal vein, or it can occur in the branches of the portal vein within the liver itself. It can be an occluding thrombus or nonoccluding, with a clot present but continued blood flow through the vessel. The sequela of a long-standing PVT is cavernous formation of the portal vein, which represents bridging collaterals around the occlusion.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001409" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Portal hypertension</a></h3>
	Increased pressure in the portal vein.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Portal hypertension is defined as portal vein pressures exceeding 5 mm Hg or portal vein to hepatic vein gradient of greater than 10 mm Hg.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000802" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impotence</a></h3>
	Inability to develop or maintain an erection of the penis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002092" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pulmonary hypertension</a></h3>
	Pulmonary hypertension is defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 25 mm Hg during rest (normal level, 10 mm Hg) or greater than 30 mm Hg during exercise (normal level, 15 mm Hg), as determined with right heart catheterization.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Pulmonary hypertension can be secondary to known cardiac, pulmonary, or hepatic disease. If no cause is identifiable, the term primary pulmonary hypertension is used.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001297" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Stroke</a></h3>
	Sudden impairment of blood flow to a part of the brain due to occlusion or rupture of an artery to the brain.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012086" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal urinary color</a></h3>
	An abnormal color of the urine, that is, the color of the urine appears different from the usual straw-yellow color.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003641" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hemoglobinuria</a></h3>
	The presence of free hemoglobin in the urine.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
If, following hemolysis, haptoglobins (hemoglobin-binding proteins) are saturated, then free hemoglobin appears in the urine.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012543" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hemosiderinuria</a></h3>
	The presence of hemosiderin in the urine.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hemosiderinuria leads to a brown color of urine. It is a marker of chronic intravascular hemolysis, in which hemoglobin is released from RBCs into the bloodstream in excess of the binding capacity of haptoglobin.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012378" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Fatigue</a></h3>
	A subjective feeling of tiredness characterized by a lack of energy and motivation.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Fatigue is distinct from muscle weakness.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002015" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dysphagia</a></h3>
	Difficulty in swallowing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100749" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Chest pain</a></h3>
	An unpleasant sensation characterized by physical discomfort (such as pricking, throbbing, or aching) localized to the chest.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002027" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abdominal pain</a></h3>
	An unpleasant sensation characterized by physical discomfort (such as pricking, throbbing, or aching) and perceived to originate in the abdomen.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012211" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal renal physiology</a></h3>
	An abnormal functionality of the kidney.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002718" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent bacterial infections</a></h3>
	Increased susceptibility to bacterial infections, as manifested by recurrent episodes of bacterial infection.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002841" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent fungal infections</a></h3>
	Increased susceptibility to fungal infections, as manifested by recurrent episodes of fungal infection.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001197" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of prenatal development or birth</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the fetus or the birth of the fetus, excluding structural abnormalities.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Because of the close link between prenatal developmental abnormalities and abnormalities of the birth process, a single term is chosen to subsume both classes of abnormality.
