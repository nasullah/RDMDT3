  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Primary spontaneous pneumothorax, AND
One or more first, second or third degree relative with primary spontaneous pneumothorax

Disease status of apparently unaffected participants should be determined according to standard clinical practice to detect cryptic disease.

Unaffected individuals should not be recruited. Recruitment in such families should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Syndromic pneumothorax (following review within by specialist respiratory/genetics service)</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice: 
 Consideration of FLCN and FBN1</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A bulging, weakened area in the wall of the thoracic aorta.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001083" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ectopia lentis</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Dislocation or malposition of the crystalline lens of the eye. A partial displacement (or dislocation) of the lens is described as a subluxation of the lens, while a complete displacement is termed luxation of the lens. A complete displacement occurs if the lens is completely outside the patellar fossa of the lens, either in the anterior chamber, in the vitreous, or directly on the retina. If the lens is partially displaced but still contained within the lens space, then it is termed subluxation.</p>

Comment:
This term now covers many of the historical inexact descriptions such as Bird-like facies that probably should be avoided in modern genetics. This portion of the Ontology should be revised.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000218" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">High palate</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Height of the palate more than 2 SD above the mean (objective) or palatal height at the level of the first permanent molar more than twice the height of the teeth (subjective).

Comment:
The measuring device for this assessment is described in (Hall JG, Froster-Iskenius UG, Allanson JE, Gripp K, Slavotinek A. 2006. Handbook of Normal Physical Measurements. 2nd edition. Oxford Medical, publishers). A high palate is often associated with a narrow palate. However, a narrow palate can easily give a false appearance of a high palate. Height and width of the palate should be assessed and coded separately. We do not recommend the subjective determination because this term can be overused and
applied inaccurately.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002664" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neoplasm</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An organ or organ-system abnormality that consists of uncontrolled autonomous cell-proliferation which can occur in any part of the body as a benign or malignant neoplasm (tumour).

Comment:
The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies neoplasms into four main groups: (i) benign neoplasm, (ii) in situ neoplasm, (iii) malignant neoplasm, and (iv) neoplasm of uncertain or unknown behavior. A malignant neoplasm is also known as cancer.</p>

Comment:
Renal oncocytoma is seen in Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (OMIM 135150).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005584" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Renal cell carcinoma</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A type of carcinoma of the kidney with origin in the epithelium of the proximal convoluted renal tubule.

Comment:
Renal cell carcinoma (also known as hypernephroma) is the most common form of kidney cancer arising from the proximal renal tubule. The tissue of origin for renal cell carcinoma is the proximal renal tubular epithelium. Renal cell carcinoma can be classified as 1) clear cell carcinoma, 2) papillary carcinoma, 3) chromophobe renal carcinoma, and 4) collecting duct carcinoma.</p>
