<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Rare distinctive phenotype<br />
- There is a high chance of a monogenic basis for the disorder as assessed by<br />
presentation and family history<br />
- Phenotype can include distinctive, undescribed imaging, biopsy or biochemical<br />
findings<br />
- Family has been reviewed by a 100,000 Genomes Project-focused multidisciplinary team (MDT) within the GMC and approved for recruitment<br />
- The GMC recruiting the patient has not exceeded its cap on recruitment to ultra-rare undescribed monogenic disorders. It is the responsibility of the GMC rare disease lead to oversee adherence to this cap<br />
- The depth of phenotype data supplied is equivalent to the disease-specific<br />
data models<br />
- The disorder has been allocated to a disease-facing GeCIP domain to provide support for clinical interpretation<br />
- A gene panel has been submitted by the recruiting clinician or GMC MDT to<br />
allow the sample to enter the analysis pipeline

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Patient would be eligible for recruitment under existing disease-specific<br />
Eligibility Criteria<br />
- Multiple families with similar phenotypes are available for recruitment; this<br />
phenotype should be proposed using the disease nomination form to develop<br />
disease-specific eligibility criteria<br />
- (Please contact chiefscientist@genomicsengland.co.uk for advice if this is unclear for this family)<br />
- Patientâ€™s phenotype has been previously assessed by Genomics England and considered out of scope for the programme

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
- As per phenotype, according to recommendation of GMC MDT

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	Ab abnormality of the endocrine system.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The endocrine system is composed of glands that secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream and includes the following glands: thyroid, parathyroids, adrenals, pancreas, gonads (testicles and ovaries), and pituitary. Many other organs, such as the kidney, liver, and heart, have secondary endocrine functions.
