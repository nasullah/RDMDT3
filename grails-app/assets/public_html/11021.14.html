						<!-- <h2>Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm Disease eligibility</h2> -->
Relevant Diseases:<br />
- Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and dissection <br />
- Thoracic aortopathy < 50 years with no other established risk factors <br />
- Clinically diagnosed Marfan syndrome with no FBN1 mutation <br />
- Loeys-Dietz syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome like conditions <br />
- Mutation negative Congenital Contractural Arachnodactyly (Beals syndrome)

<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
- patients suspected to have the above conditions<br />
Individuals with severe or syndromic disease should be recruited according to standard guidance, typically as trios. Disease status of apparently unaffected participants should be determined according to standard clinical practice to detect cryptic disease.  In other cases, unaffected individuals should not be recruited. Recruitment in such families should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs.

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
- Sporadic thoracic aortopathies with risk factors<br />
- Family history with no affected proband to test

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
 - Loeys-Dietz syndrome TGFBR1 and TGFBR2<br />
 - Marfan Syndrome FBN1<br />
 - Congenital Contractural Arachnodactyly FBN2<br />
 - Isolated familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissection - ACTA2

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	A foot where the plantar arch is in contact with the ground or floor when the individual is standing; or, in a patient lying supine, a foot where the arch is in contact with the surface of a flat board pressed against the sole of the foot by the examiner with a pressure similar to that expected from weight bearing; or, the height of the arch is reduced.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000268" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dolichocephaly</a></h3>
	An abnormality of skull shape characterized by a increased anterior-posterior diameter, i.e., an increased antero-posterior dimension of the skull. Cephalic index less than 76%. Alternatively, an apparently increased antero-posterior length of the head compared to width. Often due to premature closure of the sagittal suture.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Cephalic index is the ratio of head width expressed as a percentage of head length. The normal range is 76-80.9%. Head length is measured between the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) and the most prominent part of the occiput in the midline, using spreading calipers. Head width is measured between the most lateral points of the parietal bones on each side of the head, using spreading calipers. Cephalic index standards are derived from Caucasians and have limited relevance for other races and ethnicities. Current norms have limited validity because of changes in infant sleeping position and consequent changes in head shape. New data should be developed. Dolichocephaly is distinct from Prominent occiput, but both can be present in the same individual and should be coded separately. Scaphocephaly is a subtype of dolichocephaly where the anterior and posterior aspects of the cranial vault are pointed (boat-shaped).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000508" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ptosis</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000278" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Retrognathia</a></h3>
	An abnormality in which the mandible is mislocalised posteriorly.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000175" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft palate</a></h3>
	Cleft palate is a developmental defect of the palate resulting from a failure of fusion of the palatine processes and manifesting as a separation of the roof of the mouth (soft and hard palate).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Cleft palate is a developmental defect that occurs between the 7th and 12th week of pregnancy. Normally, the palatine processes fuse during this time to form the soft and hard palate. A failure of fusion results in a cleft palate. The clinical spectrum ranges from bifid uvula, to (incomplete or complete) cleft of the soft palate, up to (complete or incomplete) cleft of both the soft and hard palate.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000193" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Bifid uvula</a></h3>
	Uvula separated into two parts most easily seen at the tip.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009901" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Crumpled ear</a></h3>
	Distortion of the course of the normal folds of the ear and the appearance of supernumerary crura and folds.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This is distinct from Stahl ear and Shell ear, with which the term has sometimes been conflated. The appearance often changes markedly after birth.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000545" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Myopia</a></h3>
	An abnormality of refraction characterized by the ability to see objects nearby clearly, while objects in the distance appear blurry.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001083" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ectopia lentis</a></h3>
	Dislocation or malposition of the crystalline lens of the eye. A partial displacement (or dislocation) of the lens is described as a subluxation of the lens, while a complete displacement is termed luxation of the lens. A complete displacement occurs if the lens is completely outside the patellar fossa of the lens, either in the anterior chamber, in the vitreous, or directly on the retina. If the lens is partially displaced but still contained within the lens space, then it is termed subluxation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000541" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Retinal detachment</a></h3>
	Separation of the inner layers of the retina (neural retina) from the pigment epithelium.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000974" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperextensible skin</a></h3>
	A condition in which the skin can be stretched beyond normal, and then returns to its initial position.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Skin hyperelasticity is to be distinguished from cutis laxa, which refers to extra, redundant skin which tends to hang in folds.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001065" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Striae distensae</a></h3>
	Thinned, erythematous, depressed bands of atrophic skin. Initially, striae appear as flattened and thinned, pinkish linear regions of the skin. Striae tend to enlarge in length and become reddish or purplish. Later, striae tend to appear as white, depressed bands that are parallel to the lines of skin tension. Striae distensae occur most often in areas that have been subject to distension such as the lower back, buttocks, thighs, breast, abdomen, and shoulders.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000987" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Atypical scarring of skin</a></h3>
	Atypically scarred skin .
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000130" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the uterus</a></h3>
