  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Presumed Kyphoscoliotic Ehlers Danlos Syndrome with no genetic diagnosis with two or more of the following features:
•	Significant Joint hypermobility and dislocations
•	Skin fragility and hyperextensibility
•	Kyphoscoliosis
•	Increased length at birth with wrist drop
•	Muscular hypotonia
•	Criss-cross lines on palm and soles
•	Hearing impairment
•	Ocular fragility</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Known genetic aetiology
•	Kyphoscoliosis as part of an underlying genetic / syndromal diagnosis
•	Symptomatic joint hypermobility without additional confirmed diagnostic features such as kyphoscoliosis</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:

- PLOD1
- If seen in Specialist EDS Centres (London/ Sheffield): Kyphoscoliotic targeted gene panel</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

Comment:
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.</p>

Comment:
This term describes any abnormality of the voice, i.e., of the sounds produced by humans by the passage of air through the larynx and over the vocal cords, and then modified by the resonance organs, the nasopharynx, and the mouth.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000501" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Glaucoma</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Glaucoma refers loss of retinal ganglion cells in a characteristic pattern of optic neuropathy usually associated with increased intraocular pressure.

Comment:
The feature that differentiates glaucoma from other causes of visual morbidity is a characteristic pattern of damage to the optic nerve head. This is most easily recognised at the superior and inferior poles of the optic disc. The vertical cup:disc ratio (VCDR) has proved to be a simple, relatively robust index of glaucomatous loss of the neuroretinal rim. As with intraocular pressure, VCDR is a continuous variable within the population.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A height below that which is expected according to age and gender norms. Although there is no universally accepted definition of short stature, many refer to &quot;short stature&quot; as height more than 2 standard deviations below the mean for age and gender (or below the 3rd percentile for age and gender dependent norms).</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A flexion contracture is a bent (flexed) joint that cannot be straightened actively or passively. It is thus a chronic loss of joint motion due to structural changes in muscle, tendons, ligaments, or skin that prevents normal movement of joints.</p>
