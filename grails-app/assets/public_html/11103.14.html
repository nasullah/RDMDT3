						<!-- <h2>Congenital myopathy eligibility</h2> -->
Relevant diseases:<br />
<br />
- Congenital myopathy

<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
- Muscle weakness<br />
- ne or more of the following histopathological features<br />
  - type 1 predominance or uniformity<br />
  - congenital fibre type disproportion<br />
  - central cores<br />
  - multi-minicores<br />
  - nemaline rods<br />
  - central nuclei<br />
<br />
- Availability of CK, muscle CT/MR imaging, muscle biopsy and neurophysiological studies

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
- Absence of muscle weakness<br />
- CK more than 5x normal<br />
- dystrophic features on muscle biopsy

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
 

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001520" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Large for gestational age</a></h3>
	The term large for gestational age applies to babies whose birth weight lies above the 90th percentile for that gestational age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Fetal macrosomia has been defined in several different ways, including birth weight of 4000-4500 g (8 lb 13 oz to 9 lb 15 oz) or greater than 90% for gestational age after correcting for neonatal sex and ethnicity. Based on these definitions, macrosomia affects 1-10% of all pregnancies. A diagnosis of fetal macrosomia can be made only by measuring birth weight after delivery; therefore, the condition is confirmed only retrospectively, ie, after delivery of the neonate.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002705" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">High, narrow palate</a></h3>
	The presence of a high and narrow palate.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002652" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Skeletal dysplasia</a></h3>
	A general term describing features characterized by abnormal development of bones and connective tissues.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The word skeletal dysplasia is most often used to describe a group of over 380 inherited conditions that involve abnormal development of bones and connective tissues. However, the word can also be used to describe the presence of a congenital defects of bones or connective tissues that are found in one or more of the diseases, especially on prenatal ultrasound, i.e., a situation in which it is often not yet possible to make an exact etiological diagnosis. This is the sense of the phrase we use in the HPO. It is, however, preferable to annotate the observed abnormalities.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003236" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Elevated serum creatine phosphokinase</a></h3>
	An elevation of the level of the enzyme creatine kinase (also known as creatine phosphokinase, CPK; EC 2.7.3.2) in the blood. CPK levels can be elevated in a number of clinical disorders such as myocardial infarction, rhabdomyolysis, and muscular dystrophy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003687" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Centrally nucleated skeletal muscle fibers</a></h3>
	An abnormality in which the nuclei of sarcomeres take on an abnormally central localization (or in which this feature is found in an increased proportion of muscle cells).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Normally, the nuclei of muscle cells are located peripherally, immediately under the plasma membrane (sarcolemma).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004303" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of muscle fibers</a></h3>
	Any abnormality of the skeletal muscle cell. Muscle fibers are subdivided into two types. Type I fibers are fatigue-resistant and rich in oxidative enzymes (they stain light with the myosin ATPase reaction), and type II fibers are fast-contracting, fatigue-prone, and rich in glycolytic enzymes (these fibers stain darkly). Normal muscle tissue has a random distribution of type I and type II fibers.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Skeletal muscle fibers are cylindrical multinucleated muscle cells. This feature is meant to group abnormalities appreciated by histology, electron microscopy, and similar methods that allow individual cells to be visualized.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003789" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Minicore (multicore) myopathy</a></h3>
	Multiple small zones of sarcomeric disorganization and lack of oxidative activity (known as minicores) in muscle fibers.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003798" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nemaline bodies</a></h3>
	Nemaline rods are abnormal bodies that can occur in skeletal muscle fibers. The rods can be observed on histological analysis of muscle biopsy tissue or upon electron microscopy, where they appear either as extensions of sarcomeric Z-lines, in random array without obvious attachment to Z-lines (often in areas devoid of sarcomeres) or in large clusters localized at the sarcolemma or intermyofibrillar spaces.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding can be demonstrated by muscle biopsy, which shows nemaline bodies (rods) on Gomori trichrome staining.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010546" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Muscle fibrillation</a></h3>
	Fine, rapid twitching of individual muscle fibers with little or no movement of the muscle as a whole. If a motor neuron or its axon is destroyed, the muscle fibers it innervates undergo denervation atrophy. This leads to hypersensitivity of individual muscle fibers to acetyl choline so that they may contract spontaneously. Isolated activity of individual muscle fibers is generally so fine it cannot be seen through the intact skin, although it can be recorded as a short-duration spike in the EMG.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003803" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Type 1 muscle fiber predominance</a></h3>
	An abnormal predominance of type I muscle fibers (in general, this feature can only be observed on muscle biopsy).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding is demonstrated by muscle biopsy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030230" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Central core regions in muscle fibers</a></h3>
	The presence of disorganized areas called cores in the center of muscle fibers. There is a typical appearance of the biopsy on light microscopy, where the muscle cells have cores that are devoid of mitochondria and specific enzymes. Cores are typically well demarcated and centrally located, but may occasionally be multiple and of eccentric.
