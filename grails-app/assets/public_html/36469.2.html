  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Clinical features consistent with cerebral small vessel disease: either lacunar stroke or vascular cognitive impairment/dementia, AND
•	MRI confirmed evidence of cerebral small vessel disease as evidenced by; multiple lacunar infarcts and/or confluent white matter hyperintensities, AND
•	Early onset cerebral SVD (&lt;60 years) without cardiovascular risk factors or affected first degree family member

Individuals with severe or syndromic disease should be recruited according to standard guidance, typically as trios. Disease status of apparently unaffected participants should be determined according to standard clinical practice to detect cryptic disease.

In other cases, unaffected individuals should not be recruited. Recruitment in such families should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Causes of white matter disease other than cerebral small vessel disease (e.g. multiple sclerosis, vasculitis, leukodystrophy).
•	Cases with NOTCH3 mutations</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
NOTCH3</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A type of migraine in which there is an aura characterized by focal neurological phenomena that usually proceed, but may accompany or occur in the absence of, the headache. The symptoms of an aura may include fully reversible visual, sensory, and speech symptoms but not motor weakness. Visual symptoms may include flickering lights, spots and lines and/or loss of vision and/or unilateral sensory symptoms such as paresthesias or numbness. At least one of the symptoms of an aura develops gradually over 5 or more minutes and/or different symptoms occur in succession.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002083" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Migraine without aura</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Repeated headache attacks lasting 4-72 h fulfilling at least two of the following criteria: 1) unilateral location, 2) pulsating quality, 3) moderate or severe pain intensity, and 4) aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity such as climbing stairs. Headache attacks are commonly accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia.

Comment:
The definition of this term is based on the definition in the International Classification of Headache Disorders by the International Headache Society (pmid:15304572), which additionally stipulate that such headaches must have occurred at least five times and not other secondary cause must be apparent in order to make the diagnosis.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of the cerebral white matter.

Comment:
This finding can be demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging, especially with t2 signalling. The cerebral white matter is the region of the central nervous system that  consists mostly of glial cells and myelinated axons that interconnect the various regions of the cerebrum and the lower brain centers. It is located in the subcortex.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.

Comment:
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.</p>

Comment:
Characterized by a sudden increase in muscle tone whereby the body, arms, or legs make sudden stiffening movements and consciousness is usually preserved. Tonic seizures can occur during sleep. Tonic seizures usually affect both sides of the body, and cause a fall if the affected person was standing when the seizure started.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Any noninflammatory disease of the retina. This nonspecific term is retained here because of its wide use in the literature, but if possible new annotations should indicate the precise type of retinal abnormality.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.

Comment:
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009900" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Unilateral deafness</a></h3>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Encephalopathy is a term that means brain disease, damage, or malfunction. In general, encephalopathy is manifested by an altered mental state.

Comment:
This term and its children are general and bundled terms that are kept for convenience. For new annotations, it is recommended that the specific phenotypic abnormalities be noted.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001288" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Gait disturbance</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The term gait disturbance can refer to any disruption of the ability to walk. In general, this can refer to neurological diseases but also fractures or other sources of pain that is triggered upon walking. However, in the current context gait disturbance refers to difficulty walking on the basis of a neurological or muscular disease.

Comment:
If possible, this term should not be used for new annotations. Rather, a more specific term should be sought.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- oder overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly).

Comment:
Ataxia can be differentiated into dyssynergy, asynergy, dysmetria (hypometria, hypermetria), dysdiadochokinesis, gait ataxia, truncal ataxia, limb ataxia, and dysarthria). Note: This term does not include sensory ataxia.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An atrial arrhythmia characterized by disorganized atrial activity without discrete P waves on the surface EKG, but instead by an undulating baseline or more sharply circumscribed atrial deflections of varying amplitude an frequency ranging from 350 to 600 per minute.

Comment:
The ventricular response to atrial fibrillation is irregularly irregular because of the large number of atrial impulses that transit the atrioventricular node, making the ventricle partially refractory to further impulses. Atrial fibrillation can cause a number of manifestations including excessive ventricular response with angina pectoris or hypotension in susceptible individuals, syncope, systemic embolization, fatigue, or anxiety. These features should be coded separately.</p>
