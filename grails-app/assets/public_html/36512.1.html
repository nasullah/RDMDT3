						<!-- <h2>Cerebellar hypoplasia Phenotypes</h2> -->

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002194" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Delayed gross motor development</a></h3>
	A type of motor delay characterized by an delay in acquiring the ability to control the large muscles of the body for walking, running, sitting, and crawling.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010862" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Delayed fine motor development</a></h3>
	A type of motor delay characterized by an delay in acquiring the ability to control the fingers and hands.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000750" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Delayed speech and language development</a></h3>
	A degree of language development that is significantly below the norm for a child of a specified age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Language delay can be characterized by a failure to meet the developmental milestones for language development, an inability to follow directions, or slow or incomprehensible speech after the age of three years, as well as with severe problems with syntax or articulation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000256" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Macrocephaly</a></h3>
	Occipitofrontal (head) circumference greater than 97th centile compared to appropriate, age matched, sex-matched normal standards. Alternatively, a apparently increased size of the cranium.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far above the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Macrocephaly is an absolute term. The term relative macrocephaly can be used when the head size centile exceeds the centile for height, for example, head size at the 75th centile with height at the 5th centile for age and sex.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001290" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Generalized hypotonia</a></h3>
	Generalized muscular hypotonia (abnormally low muscle tone).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001272" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebellar atrophy</a></h3>
	Atrophy (wasting) of the cerebellum.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Cerebellar atrophy can be diagnosed if the cerebellum is small with shrunken folia and large cerebellar fissures or if it has been shown to undergo progressive volume loss.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001305" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dandy-Walker malformation</a></h3>
	A congenital brain malformation typically characterized by incomplete formation of the cerebellar vermis, dilation of the fourth ventricle, and enlargement of the posterior fossa. In layman's terms, Dandy Walker malformation is a cyst in the cerebellum (typically symmetrical) that is involved with the fourth ventricle. This may interfere with the ability to drain cerebrospinal fluid from the brain, resulting in hydrocephalus. Dandy Walker cysts are formed during early embryonic development, while the brain forms. The cyst in the cerebellum typically has several blood vessels running through it connecting to the brain, thereby prohibiting surgical removal.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001321" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebellar hypoplasia</a></h3>
	Underdevelopment of the cerebellum.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
By prenatal ultrasound, cerebellar hypoplasia is diagnosed if the cerebellum measures more than two standard deviations below the mean. In adults, cerebellar hypoplasia is typically diagnosed by computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebellar hypoplasia can be diagnosed if there is a small cerebellum with fissures of normal size compared with the folia (this is a distinguishing characteristic compared with cerebellar atrophy).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012642" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebellar agenesis</a></h3>
	Lack of development of the cerebellum.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Usually, small remnants of the cerebellum are present; therefore the term subtotal cerebellar agenesis is also used in the literature.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001320" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebellar vermis hypoplasia</a></h3>
	Underdevelopment of the vermis of cerebellum.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100307" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebellar hemisphere hypoplasia</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007033" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebellar dysplasia</a></h3>
	The presence of developmental dysplasia of the cerebellum.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006955" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Olivopontocerebellar hypoplasia</a></h3>
	Hypoplasia of the cerebellum, pontine nuclei, and inferior olivary nucleus.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002419" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Molar tooth sign on MRI</a></h3>
	An abnormal appearance of the midbrain in axial magnetic resonance imaging in which the elongated superior cerebellar peduncles give the midbrain an appearance reminiscent of a molar or wisdom tooth.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Molar tooth appearance results from a lack of normal decussation of superior cerebellar peduncular fiber tracts which in turn leads to enlargement of the peduncles, which also follow a more horizontal course. The absence of crossing fibers also leads to a reduction in the anteroposterior diameter of the midbrain and deepening of the interpeduncular cistern.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007099" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Arnold-Chiari type I malformation</a></h3>
	Arnold-Chiari type I malformation refers to a relatively mild degree of herniation of the posteroinferior region of the cerebellum (the cerebellar tonsils) into the cervical canal with little or no displacement of the fourth ventricle.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002350" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebellar cyst</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0040010" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Small posterior fossa</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002084" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Encephalocele</a></h3>
	A neural tube defect characterized by sac-like protrusions of the brain and the membranes that cover it through openings in the skull.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
A congenital gap in the skull that usually results in a protrusion of brain material.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002280" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Enlarged cisterna magna</a></h3>
	Increase in size of the cisterna magna, one of three principal openings in the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid and pia mater, located between the cerebellum and the dorsal surface of the medulla oblongata.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Cerebrospinal fluid produced in the fourth ventricle drains into the cisterna magna via the lateral apertures and median aperture.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012110" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypoplasia of the pons</a></h3>
	Underdevelopment of the pons.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002363" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of brainstem morphology</a></h3>
	An anomaly of the brainstem.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002538" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the cerebral cortex</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the cerebral cortex.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002500" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the cerebral white matter</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the cerebral white matter.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding can be demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging, especially with t2 signalling. The cerebral white matter is the region of the central nervous system that  consists mostly of glial cells and myelinated axons that interconnect the various regions of the cerebrum and the lower brain centers. It is located in the subcortex.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002134" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the basal ganglia</a></h3>
	Abnormality of the basal ganglia.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei (striatum, pallidum substantia nigra, and the subthalamic nucleus) at the base of the forebrain that are connected to the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, and other areas. The basal ganglia subserve motor functions that are distinct from those of the pyramidal (corticospinal) tract, for which reason neurologic abnormalities caused by lesions to the basal ganglia are often referred to as extrapyramidal.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100702" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Arachnoid cyst</a></h3>
	An extra-parenchymal and intra-arachnoidal collection of fluid with a composition similar to that of cerebrospinal fluid.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Arachnoid cysts can be found on the brain, or on the spine. Intracranial arachnoid cysts usually occur adjacent to the arachnoidal cistern. Spinal arachnoid cysts may be extradural, intradural, or perineural.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001273" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the corpus callosum</a></h3>
	Abnormality of the corpus callosum.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The corpus callosum, a broad thick band of nerve fibers that connects the right and left cerebral hemispheres, is the largest white matter structure in the brain. This finding can be demonstrated by cerebral magenetic resonance tomography. The corpus callosum structurally consists of 4 major anatomic features including the rostrum, genu, corpus, and splenium.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010663" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of thalamus morphology</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the thalamus.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002126" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Polymicrogyria</a></h3>
	A congenital abnormality of the cerebral hemisphere characterized by an excessive number of small gyri (convolutions) on the surface of the brain.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Polymicrogyria, one of the most common malformations of cortical development, is characterized histologically by the appearance of an excessive number of small cortical folds, often fused together, with disordered cortical lamination.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000639" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nystagmus</a></h3>
	Rhythmic, involuntary oscillations of one or both eyes related to abnormality in fixation, conjugate gaze, or vestibular mechanisms.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009830" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Peripheral neuropathy</a></h3>
	Peripheral neuropathy is a general term for any disorder of the peripheral nervous system. The main clinical features used to classify peripheral neuropathy are distribution, type (mainly demyelinating versus mainly axonal), duration, and course.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000763" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sensory neuropathy</a></h3>
	Peripheral neuropathy affecting the sensory nerves.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100021" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebral palsy</a></h3>
	Cerebral palsy describes a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitation, that are attributed to nonprogressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain. The motor disorders of cerebral palsy are often accompanied by disturbances of sensation, perception, cognition, communication, and behaviour, by epilepsy, and by secondary musculoskeletal problems.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000657" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Oculomotor apraxia</a></h3>
	Inability to follow objects visually with compensatory head movements, decreased smooth pursuit, and cancellation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Oculomotor apraxia leads defective or absent horizontal voluntary eye movements with head thrusting to look at objects to the side as well as jerky, abnormal eye movements.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000556" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Retinal dystrophy</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001999" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal facial shape</a></h3>
	An abnormal morphology (form) of the face or its components.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term now covers many of the historical inexact descriptions such as Bird-like facies that probably should be avoided in modern genetics. This portion of the Ontology should be revised.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012210" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal renal morphology</a></h3>
	Any structural anomaly of the kidney.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002910" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Elevated hepatic transaminases</a></h3>
	Elevations of the levels of SGOT and SGPT in the serum. SGOT (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase) and SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase) are transaminases primarily found in the liver and heart and are released into the bloodstream as the result of liver or heart damage. SGOT and SGPT are used clinically mainly as markers of liver damage.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002564" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Malformation of the heart and great vessels</a></h3>
	Congenital malformation of the heart or great vessels (i.e., the large blood vesslesentering and leaving the heart: aorta, the pulmonary arteries and veins, and the superior and inferior vena cava).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This category is meant to comprise congenital (developmental) structural heart defects.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011675" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Arrhythmia</a></h3>
	Any cardiac rhythm other than the normal sinus rhythm. Such a rhythm may be either of sinus or ectopic origin and either regular or irregular. An arrhythmia may be due to a disturbance in impulse formation or conduction or both.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
	A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
	Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001251" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ataxia</a></h3>
	Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- oder overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Ataxia can be differentiated into dyssynergy, asynergy, dysmetria (hypometria, hypermetria), dysdiadochokinesis, gait ataxia, truncal ataxia, limb ataxia, and dysarthria). Note: This term does not include sensory ataxia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002119" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ventriculomegaly</a></h3>
	An increase in size of the ventricular system of the brain.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000486" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Strabismus</a></h3>
	Strabismus (also known as squint) is a condition in which the eyes are not properly aligned with each other.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000407" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sensorineural hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A type of hearing impairment  in one or both ears related to an abnormal functionality of the cochlear nerve.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss caused by damage or dysfunction of the auditory nerve (cranial nerve VIII, also known as the cochlear nerve).
