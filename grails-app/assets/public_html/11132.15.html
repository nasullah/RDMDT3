  <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>

  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Proband is affected by endocrine tumour (age &lt;60)  
- &gt;=1 additional endocrine tumour (any age) in patient or family member (FDR, SDR, TDR) (age &lt;60).  
Sample should be sought from affected family members if alive [endocrine tumours: parathyroid hyperplasia, pituitary adenoma, GIT neuroendocrine tumour, carcinoid tumours, adrenocortical tumours, medullary thyroid carcinoma, phaeochromocytoma]
Unaffected individuals should not be recruited in this disorder. Recruitment should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing as below is strongly recommended PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT to allow appropriate management of families with readily detectable mutations in known disease genes: 
- MEN1 (MEN1-like spectrum) 
- MEN1 and AIP (if pituitary tumours only) 
- RET (MEN2-like spectrum)</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A benign epithelial tumor derived from intrinsic cells of the adenohypophysis.

Comment:
In most cases pituitary adenoma are histologically benign, slow-growing, small neoplasms confined to the sella turcica. Some pituitary adenomas are more aggressive, grow faster, invade surrounding tissues, and cause local symptoms such as visual disturbances, headache, and varying degrees of hypopituitarism.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Pheochromocytomas (also known as chromaffin tumors) produce, store, and secrete catecholamines. Pheochromocytomas usually originate from the adrenal medulla but may also develop from chromaffin cells in or about sympathetic ganglia. A common symptom of pheochromocytoma is hypertension owing to release of catecholamines.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Acromegaly is a condition resulting from overproduction of growth hormone by the pituitary gland in persons with closed epiphyses, and consists chiefly in the enlargement of the distal parts of the body. The circumference of the skull increases, the nose becomes broad, the tongue becomes enlarged, the facial features become coarsened, the mandible grows excessively, and the teeth become separated. The fingers and toes grow chiefly in thickness.

Comment:
Disorder resulting from excess pituitary gland production of growth hormone (hGH).</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Calcitonin is a 32-amino acid polypeptide hormone that is produced primarily by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid. It acts to reduce blood calcium (Ca2+), opposing the effects of parathyroid hormone.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012197" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Insulinoma</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A type of tumor of the pancreatic beta cells that secretes excess insulin and can result in hypoglycemia.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002044" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Zollinger-Ellison syndrome</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A condition in which there is increased production of gastrin by a gastrin-secreting tumor (usually located in the pancreas, duodenum, or abdominal lymph nodes) that stimulates the gastric mucosa to maximal activity, with consequent gastrointestinal mucosal ulceration.

Comment:
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may occur as a manifestation of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000179" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Thick lower lip vermilion</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Increased thickness of the lower lip, leading to a prominent appearance of the lower lip. The height of the vermilion of the lower lip in the midline is more than 2 SD above the mean. Alternatively, an apparently increased height of the vermilion of the lower lip in the frontal view (subjective).

Comment:
Normal values for the height of the vermilion are available [Farkas, 1981] but measurements are not commonly used. Most clinicians determine this feature subjectively. The lower lip is typically thicker than the upper one. The height of the vermilion of the lower lip varies among ethnic groups, and the vermilion should
be compared to a population of same ethnic background. When the vermilion is thick, it is more convex and more everted than usual on profile view, but that should be assessed separately.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003005" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ganglioneuroma</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A benign neoplasm that usually arises from the sympathetic trunk in the mediastinum, representing a tumor of the sympathetic nerve fibers arising from neural crest cells.

Comment:
Ganglioneuromas and ganglioneuroblastomas are tumors of the sympathetic nervous system. They originate from neural crest sympathogonia, which are completely undifferentiated cells of the sympathetic nervous system.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000574" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Thick eyebrow</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Increased density/number and/or increased diameter of eyebrow hairs.

Comment:
Thickness can be regional (medial, middle/central, lateral) or total.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001031" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Subcutaneous lipoma</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The presence of subcutaneous lipoma.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000957" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cafe-au-lait spot</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Cafe-au-lait spots are hyperpigmented lesions that can vary in color from light brown to dark brown with smooth borders and having a size of 1.5 cm or more in adults and 0.5 cm or more in children.

Comment:
The phrase cafe-au-lait comes from the French word for milk-coffee. A single cafe-au-lait spot can be an isolated finding in otherwise normal individuals. Multiple cafe-au-lait spots often indicate the presence of neurofibromatosis type 1 but may also be seen in other diseases including McCune-Albright syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Fanconi anemia.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002751" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Kyphoscoliosis</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormal curvature of the spine in both a coronal (lateral) and sagittal (back-to-front) plane.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000767" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pectus excavatum</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A defect of the chest wall characterized by a depression of the sternum, giving the chest (&quot;pectus&quot;) a caved-in (&quot;excavatum&quot;) appearance.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000218" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">High palate</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Height of the palate more than 2 SD above the mean (objective) or palatal height at the level of the first permanent molar more than twice the height of the teeth (subjective).

Comment:
The measuring device for this assessment is described in (Hall JG, Froster-Iskenius UG, Allanson JE, Gripp K, Slavotinek A. 2006. Handbook of Normal Physical Measurements. 2nd edition. Oxford Medical, publishers). A high palate is often associated with a narrow palate. However, a narrow palate can easily give a false appearance of a high palate. Height and width of the palate should be assessed and coded separately. We do not recommend the subjective determination because this term can be overused and
applied inaccurately.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001519" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Disproportionate tall stature</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A tall and slim body build with increased arm span to height ratio (&gt;1.05) and a reduced upper-to-lower segment ratio (&lt;0.85), i.e., unusually long arms and legs. The extremities as well as the hands and feet are unusually slim.</p>
