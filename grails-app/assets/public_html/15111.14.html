						<!-- <h2>Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
- Unexplained peripheral neuropathy affecting motor, sensory or autonomic nerves progressing over >2 years +/- additional neurological signs.

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
- History of trauma<br />
- Known acquired metabolic, vascular, inflammatory or immunological cause<br />
- History of alcohol excess<br />
- Evidence of malignancy<br />
- ENG/EMG suggest acquired pathology

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing for the chromosome 17p11.2 duplication is strongly recommended PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT as this may not be reliably detected by WGS using current analysis techniques; other tests below should be considered where this is in line with current local practice including:<br />
- PMP22 point mutations, GJB1, MPZ, MFN2 (MFN2 axonal only)

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001761" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pes cavus</a></h3>
	The presence of an unusually high plantar arch. Also called high instep, pes cavus refers to a distinctly hollow form of the sole of the foot when it is bearing weight.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009027" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Foot dorsiflexor weakness</a></h3>
	Weakness of the muscles responsible for dorsiflexion of the foot, that is, of the movement of the toes towards the shin. The foot dorsiflexors include the tibialis anterior, the extensor hallucis longus, the extensor digitorum longus, and the peroneus tertius muscles.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Dorsiflexion of the foot extends the foot superiorly, as if taking the foot off the gas pedal.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007350" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperreflexia in upper limbs</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002395" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Lower limb hyperreflexia</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002600" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyporeflexia of lower limbs</a></h3>
	Reduced intensity of muscle tendon reflexes in the lower limbs. Reflexes are elicited by stretching the tendon of a muscle, e.g., by tapping.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Reflexes are sensorimotor arcs that require some type of sensory (afferent) signal, and some motor response. While the simplest of reflexes involve direct synapse between the sensory fiber and the motor neuron (monosynaptic), many reflexes have several neurons interposed (polysynaptic reflexes). Hyporeflexia can result from a defect anywhere in this chain.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012391" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyporeflexia of upper limbs</a></h3>
	Reduced intensity of muscle tendon reflexes in the upper limbs. Reflexes are elicited by stretching the tendon of a muscle, e.g., by tapping.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006986" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Upper limb spasticity</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002061" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Lower limb spasticity</a></h3>
	Spasticity (velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes with increased muscle tone and hyperexcitable tendon reflexes) in the muscles of the lower limbs, hips, and pelvis
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008997" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Proximal muscle weakness in upper limbs</a></h3>
	A lack of strength of the proximal muscles of the arms.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008994" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Proximal muscle weakness in lower limbs</a></h3>
	A lack of strength of the proximal muscles of the legs.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008959" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Distal upper limb muscle weakness</a></h3>
	Reduced strength of the distal musculature of the arms.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009053" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Distal lower limb muscle weakness</a></h3>
	Reduced strength of the distal musculature of the legs.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding can be due to peripheral neuropathy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003327" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Axial muscle weakness</a></h3>
	Reduced strength of the axial musculature (i.e., of the muscles of the head and neck, spine, and ribs).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003202" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Skeletal muscle atrophy</a></h3>
	The presence of skeletal muscular atrophy (which is also known as amyotrophy).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010829" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired temperature sensation</a></h3>
	A reduced ability to discriminate between different temperatures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Temperature sensation can be tested by touching the skin several seconds with a water flask filled to the desired temperature. Persons with normal temperature sensation should at least be able to identify as warm a flask that is 35-36 degrees C and identify as cool a flask at 28-32 degrees C.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007328" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired pain sensation</a></h3>
	Reduced ability to perceive painful stimuli.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010831" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired proprioception</a></h3>
	A loss or impairment of the sensation of the relative position of parts of the body and joint position.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002495" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired vibratory sensation</a></h3>
	A decrease in the ability to perceive vibration. Clinically, this is usually tested with a tuning fork which vibrates at 128 Hz and is applied to bony prominences such as the malleoli at the ankles or the metacarpal-phalangeal joints. There is a slow decay of vibration from the tuning fork. The degree of vibratory sense loss can be crudely estimated by counting the number of seconds that the examiner can perceive the vibration longer than the patient.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Impaired vibratory sensation may suggesti involvement of the posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway, which is responsible for transmitting fine touch, vibration and conscious proprioceptive information from the body to the cerebral cortex.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001251" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ataxia</a></h3>
	Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- oder overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Ataxia can be differentiated into dyssynergy, asynergy, dysmetria (hypometria, hypermetria), dysdiadochokinesis, gait ataxia, truncal ataxia, limb ataxia, and dysarthria). Note: This term does not include sensory ataxia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001266" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Choreoathetosis</a></h3>
	Involuntary movements characterized by both athetosis (inability to sustain muscles in a fixed position) and chorea (widespread jerky arrhythmic movements).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001270" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Motor delay</a></h3>
	A type of Developmental delay characterized by a delay in acquiring motor skills.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002380" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Fasciculations</a></h3>
	Fasciculations are observed as small, local, involuntary muscle contractions (twitching) visible under the skin. Fasciculations result from increased irritability of an axon (which in turn is often a manifestation of disease of a motor neuron). This leads to sporadic discharges of all the muscle fibers controlled by the axon in isolation from other motor units.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding can be visible clinically and can be demonstrated by electromyography (EMG).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cataract</a></h3>
	A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000726" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dementia</a></h3>
	A loss of global cognitive ability of sufficient amount to interfere with normal social or occupational function. Dementia represents a loss of previously present cognitive abilities, generally in adults, and can affect memory, thinking, language, judgment, and behavior.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001291" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the cranial nerves</a></h3>
	Abnormality affecting one or more of the cranial nerves, which emerge directly from the brain stem.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100360" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Contractures of the joints of the upper limbs</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005750" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Contractures of the joints of the lower limbs</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002093" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Respiratory insufficiency</a></h3>
	Failure to adequately provide oxygen to cells of the body and to remove excess carbon dioxide.
