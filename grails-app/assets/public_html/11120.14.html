<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
- >5 cysts affecting one or both kidneys<br />
AND <br />
- Unaffected individuals have undergone appropriate screening for cryptic disease e.g. renal ultrasound scan <br />
- Individuals with severe or syndromic disease should be recruited according to standard guidance, preferably as trios <br />
- In other cases, unaffected individuals should not be recruited. Recruitment in such families should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs. <br />
AND <br />
- Participants with features suggestive of classical ADPKD (autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease) who have not undergone prior genetic testing of PKD1 and PKD2 should be recruited initially as singletons. In families where analysis as a singleton does not lead to identification of the underlying causative mutation, recruitment of additional affected family members is encouraged.

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
- Advanced or end-stage kidney failure due to identified (non-cystic) disease<br />
- Multicystic dysplastic kidney(s) (see CAKUT)

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
PKD1 and PKD2 if kidneys enlarged for age (or >12cm in length in adults). PKHD1 if family history and phenotype consistent with AR PKD. These genes need not be tested if other phenotypic features make them unlikely to be causative.

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
PKD1 and PKD2 if kidneys enlarged for age (or >12cm in length in adults). PKHD1 if family history and phenotype consistent with AR PKD. These genes need not be tested if other phenotypic features make them unlikely to be causative.

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	The presence of many cysts in the medulla of the kidney.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This feature is the cardinal sign of medullary cystic disease, also known as medullary sponge disease.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000803" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Renal cortical cysts</a></h3>
	Cysts of the cortex of the kidney.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100611" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Multiple glomerular cysts</a></h3>
	The presence of many cysts in the glomerulus of the kidney related to dilatation of the Bowman's capsule.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005576" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Tubulointerstitial fibrosis</a></h3>
	Fibrosis that involves the tubules and interstitial tissue of the kidney.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding is usually shown by renal biopsy. Fibrosis involves an excess accumulation of extracellular matrix and usually results in loss of function when normal tissue is replaced with scar tissue.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000092" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Tubular atrophy</a></h3>
	The presence of renal tubules with thick redundant basement membranes, or a reduction of greater than 50% in tubular diameter compared to surrounding non-atrophic tubules.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001970" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Tubulointerstitial nephritis</a></h3>
	A form of inflammation of the kidney affecting the interstitium of the kidneys surrounding the tubules.

	An abnormal increase in the size of the kidney.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The main causes of large kidney are hydronephrosis, polycystic disease, renal cell carcinoma, nephroblastoma/Wilm's tumor (in children), and solitary cysts. If possible, a specific term should be used instead of this one.

<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.

	An abnormal morphology (form) of the face or its components.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term now covers many of the historical inexact descriptions such as Bird-like facies that probably should be avoided in modern genetics. This portion of the Ontology should be revised.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009794" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Branchial anomaly</a></h3>
	Congenital developmental defect arising from the primitive branchial apparatus.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
During embryonic development the major head and neck structures are formed from the five pharyngeal arches (bands of tissue). Incomplete, failed or persistent embryonic development of these arches results in several anomalies or defects in the neck.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000356" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the outer ear</a></h3>

	An abnormality of the heart.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000819" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Diabetes mellitus</a></h3>
	A group of abnormalities characterized by hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011842" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of skeletal morphology</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the form, structure, or size of the skeletal system.

	An abnormality of the immune system.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The immune system is composed of organs and interdependent cell types that collectively protect the body from infections and from the growth of tumor cells. The organs of the immune system comprise the bone marrow, the spleen, the thymus,the lymph nodes, and the cell types comprise B cells, T cells, natural killer cells, granulocytes,dendritic cells, and macrophages.
