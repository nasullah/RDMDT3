  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Bilateral radial dysplasia, OR
•	Unilateral radial dysplasia with positive family history, parental consanguinity or additional syndromic features (such as at least one additional structural malformation, height/length or head circumference &gt;3SDs from the mean, dysmorphism, moderate or worse intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorder)</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Known genetic cause
•	Known teratogenic cause</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
- aCGH or equivalent
- Fanconi breakage testing (if features suggestive of Fanconi anaemia)
- TBX5 (if phenotype suggestive of Holt-Oram syndrome)
- RBM8A (if aCGH or clinical features suggestive of TAR syndrome)</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormal position of the hand in which the wrist is bent toward the radius (i.e., toward the thumb).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004059" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Radial club hand</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Wrist is bent inward toward the thumb because of a congenital defect associated with shortening or absence of the radius.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001245" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Small thenar eminence</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Underdevelopment of the thenar eminence with reduced palmar soft tissue mass surrounding the base of the thumb.

Comment:
The reduced soft tissue is typically abductor pollicis brevis and flexor pollicis brevis muscle bulk. Detection of this abnormality entails clinical judgment, especially in mild cases. The bulk of the muscle mass around the base of the thumb is diminished, and there may be a mild concavity over the volar aspect of the first metacarpal. When the deficiency is unilateral, comparison between the two hands will point up the often-subtle change in contour of the thenar muscles. If the degree of involvement is severe, the palm may taper in width proximally.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009777" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Absent thumb</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Absent  thumb, i.e., the absence of both phalanges of a thumb and the associated soft tissues.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009778" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short thumb</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Hypoplasia (congenital reduction in size) of the thumb.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001199" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Triphalangeal thumb</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A thumb with three phalanges in a single, proximo-distal axis. Thus, this term applies if the thumb has an accessory phalanx, leading to a digit like appearance of the thumb.

Comment:
The requirement for a single PD axis relates to the issue that partial forms of Preaxial polydactyly may comprise a partially duplicated thumb with two distal phalanges and a single proximal phalanx. That finding is instead coded as a mild form of thumb polydactyly. Note that this finding can be readily assessed by examination and/or physical manipulation of the thumb.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.

Comment:
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000272" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Malar flattening</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Underdevelopment of the malar (frontal) process of the maxilla, appreciated in profile and/or by palpation.

Comment:
The malar process is the most medial and superior portion of the maxilla, contiguous with the lateral boundary of the nasal bridge. The term malar hypoplasia is no longer preferred because surface examination cannot distinguish hypoplasia from hypotrophy.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000347" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Micrognathia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Developmental hypoplasia of the mandible.

Comment:
Mandibular hypoplasia, also known as micrognathia, is a term that describes an abnormally small lower jaw.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000175" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft palate</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Cleft palate is a developmental defect of the palate resulting from a failure of fusion of the palatine processes and manifesting as a separation of the roof of the mouth (soft and hard palate).

Comment:
Cleft palate is a developmental defect that occurs between the 7th and 12th week of pregnancy. Normally, the palatine processes fuse during this time to form the soft and hard palate. A failure of fusion results in a cleft palate. The clinical spectrum ranges from bifid uvula, to (incomplete or complete) cleft of the soft palate, up to (complete or incomplete) cleft of both the soft and hard palate.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009921" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Duane anomaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Duane anomaly is a congenital eye movement impairment with limitation of the ability to adduct or abduct the eye. When affected eyes are adducted (moved inwards towards the nose), the eyeball retracts and the palpebral fissure narrows.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001631" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Defect in the atrial septum</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a congenital abnormality of the interatrial septum that enables blood flow between the left and right atria via the interatrial septum.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011675" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Arrhythmia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Any cardiac rhythm other than the normal sinus rhythm. Such a rhythm may be either of sinus or ectopic origin and either regular or irregular. An arrhythmia may be due to a disturbance in impulse formation or conduction or both.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002937" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hemivertebrae</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Absence of one half of the vertebral body.

Comment:
Lateral hemivertebrae represent a developmental defect resulting from the failure of the contralateral chondral center to develop. Dorsal hemivertebrae result from a developmental defect in which the anterior chondral centers fail to develop, and ventral hemivertebrae result from failure of the posterior centers to ossify. The affected half of the vertebral body may by hypoplastic or absent, as is the pedicle, and (for thoracic vetebrae) the corresponding rib. The affected half of the vertebral body may also show a fusion or segmentation defect.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000957" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cafe-au-lait spot</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Cafe-au-lait spots are hyperpigmented lesions that can vary in color from light brown to dark brown with smooth borders and having a size of 1.5 cm or more in adults and 0.5 cm or more in children.

Comment:
The phrase cafe-au-lait comes from the French word for milk-coffee. A single cafe-au-lait spot can be an isolated finding in otherwise normal individuals. Multiple cafe-au-lait spots often indicate the presence of neurofibromatosis type 1 but may also be seen in other diseases including McCune-Albright syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Fanconi anemia.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001903" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anemia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A reduction in erythrocytes volume or hemoglobin concentration.

Comment:
Anemia is not a specific entity but can result from many underlying pathologic processes. The three main causes of anemia are blood loss, decreased or faulty red blood cell production, and increased destruction of red blood cells. Various classifications are in clinical use including a classification according to the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the erythrocytes: microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic. Anemias can also be classified according to variations in cell size and shape, as reflected by the red-cell distribution width (RDW). Additionally, anemias can be classified into those of inadequate production and hemolytic anemias.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001876" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pancytopenia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormal reduction in numbers of all blood cell types (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001873" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Thrombocytopenia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A reduction in the number of circulating thrombocytes.

Comment:
Thrombocytopenia can be divided into three major causes; 1) low production of platelets in the bone marrow; 2) intravascular breakdown of thrombocytes; and 3) increased turnover of platelets in spleen or liver (extravascular).</p>
