						<!-- <h2>Choanal atresia eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
- Bilateral bony choanal atresia OR<br />
- Unilateral bony choanal atresia with stenosis of the contralateral side<br />
- As above, with or without additional malformations<br />
- Skull X-rays excluding sclerosing bone dysplasias

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
- Teratogens (e.g. Carbimazole, fluconazole)

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
 - Genome-wide copy number variation testing (e.g. aCGH, SNP array or other genomic microarray)<br />
  - CHD7 if additional malformations suggestive of CHARGE syndrome<br />
  - FGFR2, FGFR3 and other genes linked to craniosynostosis if appropriate

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000453" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Choanal atresia</a></h3>
	Absence or abnormal closure of the choana (the posterior nasal aperture).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011820" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Membranous choanal atresia</a></h3>
	Absence of the normal opening of the choana (the posterior nasal aperture) as a result of an obstructing choanal membrane that may be thin and strandlike or thick and pluglike.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000452" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Choanal stenosis</a></h3>
	Abnormal narrowing of the choana (the posterior nasal aperture).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
	A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001510" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Growth delay</a></h3>
	A deficiency or slowing down of growth pre- and postnatally.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Poor or abnormally slow gains in weight or height in a child.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
	Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000820" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the thyroid gland</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the thyroid gland.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001363" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Craniosynostosis</a></h3>
	Craniosynostosis refers to the premature closure of the cranial sutures. Primary craniosynostosis refers to the closure of one or more sutures due to abnormalities in skull development, and secondary craniosynostosis results from failure of brain growth.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Skull deformity caused by the premature closure of the cranial sutures. Craniostenosis is a deformity of the skull caused by craniosynostosis, with consequent cessation of skull growth.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001999" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal facial shape</a></h3>
	An abnormal morphology (form) of the face or its components.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term now covers many of the historical inexact descriptions such as Bird-like facies that probably should be avoided in modern genetics. This portion of the Ontology should be revised.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000377" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the pinna</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the pinna, which is also referred to as the auricle or external ear.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term 'dysplastic' is no longer accepted as a descriptor for an ear with unusual morphology. Each specific anatomical component of the ear should be described when the ear is thought to be abnormal in appearance.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008551" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microtia</a></h3>
	Underdevelopment of the external ear.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The definitions of microtia follow a widely used, surgically based, classification of ear anomalies outlined by Weerda 1988. As microtia indicates at least both decreased length and width, and in more severe forms it includes abnormal shape of structures, all forms are acknowledged to be bundled terms, but are retained here because they are well established.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000372" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the auditory canal</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the External acoustic tube (also known as the auditory canal).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011380" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Morphological abnormality of the semicircular canal</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the morphology of the semicircular canal.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000405" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Conductive hearing impairment</a></h3>
	An abnormality of vibrational conductance of sound to the inner ear leading to impairment of sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
A conductive hearing impariment with greater than 90 dB loss.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000407" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sensorineural hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A type of hearing impairment  in one or both ears related to an abnormal functionality of the cochlear nerve.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss caused by damage or dysfunction of the auditory nerve (cranial nerve VIII, also known as the cochlear nerve).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000430" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Underdeveloped nasal alae</a></h3>
	Thinned, deficient, or excessively arched ala nasi.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The alae nasi are the lateral portions of the nose or the wings of the nostrils, which partly encircle the nostrils (nares). They are usually about the width of the columella, but vary greatly depending on the shape of the nostril. Note that individuals may be described as having a Cleft ala nasi, but have a severely underdeveloped ala nasi. In an underdeveloped ala the continuity of the tissue encircling the nostril is undisturbed while in a cleft it is disrupted. With severe hypoplasia of the nasal alae, the nasal tip may appear depressed.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000478" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the eye</a></h3>
	Any abnormality of the eye, including location, spacing, and intraocular abnormalities.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000316" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypertelorism</a></h3>
	Interpupillary distance more than 2 SD above the mean (alternatively, the appearance of an increased interpupillary distance or widely spaced eyes).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000579" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nasolacrimal duct obstruction</a></h3>
	Blockage of the  lacrimal duct.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000652" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Lower eyelid coloboma</a></h3>
	A short discontinuity of the margin of the lower eyelid.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000636" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Upper eyelid coloboma</a></h3>
	A short discontinuity of the margin of the upper eyelid.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000272" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Malar flattening</a></h3>
	Underdevelopment of the malar (frontal) process of the maxilla, appreciated in profile and/or by palpation.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The malar process is the most medial and superior portion of the maxilla, contiguous with the lateral boundary of the nasal bridge. The term malar hypoplasia is no longer preferred because surface examination cannot distinguish hypoplasia from hypotrophy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000204" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft upper lip</a></h3>
	A gap in the upper lip. This is a congenital defect resulting from nonfusion of tissues of the lip during embryonal development.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000175" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft palate</a></h3>
	Cleft palate is a developmental defect of the palate resulting from a failure of fusion of the palatine processes and manifesting as a separation of the roof of the mouth (soft and hard palate).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Cleft palate is a developmental defect that occurs between the 7th and 12th week of pregnancy. Normally, the palatine processes fuse during this time to form the soft and hard palate. A failure of fusion results in a cleft palate. The clinical spectrum ranges from bifid uvula, to (incomplete or complete) cleft of the soft palate, up to (complete or incomplete) cleft of both the soft and hard palate.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000193" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Bifid uvula</a></h3>
	Uvula separated into two parts most easily seen at the tip.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000347" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Micrognathia</a></h3>
	Developmental hypoplasia of the mandible.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Mandibular hypoplasia, also known as micrognathia, is a term that describes an abnormally small lower jaw.

	A congenital anomaly characterized by the presence of supernumerary fingers or toes.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002564" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Malformation of the heart and great vessels</a></h3>
	Congenital malformation of the heart or great vessels (i.e., the large blood vesslesentering and leaving the heart: aorta, the pulmonary arteries and veins, and the superior and inferior vena cava).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This category is meant to comprise congenital (developmental) structural heart defects.
