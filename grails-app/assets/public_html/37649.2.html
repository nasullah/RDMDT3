  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Proband with either HFM, Goldenhar or Oculoauriculovertebral spectrum, AND
•	At least two other relatives with features of first and second branchial arch anomalies especially macrostomia, epibulbar dermoid, asymmetric mandiular hypoplasia or microtia/ significant external ear anomaly (but not isolated preauricular pits or minor ear anomalies).</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Known cause</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
•	aCGH or equivalent
•	Preauricular pits: EYA1, SIX1
•	SALL1 (if abnormal thumbs or anal anomaly)
•	SALL4, EFTUD2 and SF3B4 (if abnormal thumbs)
•	TCOF1 (if bilateral microtia)</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of one or more of the vertebrae.

Comment:
A vertebra is one of 33 bony segments that form the spinal column of humans. There are 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral and 4 coccygeal vertebrae (the coccygeal vertebrae are fused into one coccyx bone).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100272" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Branchial sinus</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A congenital branchial sinus is a remnant of the embryonic branchial arches and their intervening clefts and pouches that has failed to regress completely. Sinuses typically have their external orifice inferior to the ramus of the mandible. They may traverse the parotid gland, and run in close vicinity to the facial nerve in the external auditory canal.

Comment:
Branchial sinuses have to be distinguished from the preauricular cysts and sinuses, which are ectodermal remnants from an aberrant development of the auditory tubercles, tend to be bilateral, and are localized anterior to the tragus of the ear.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009901" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Crumpled ear</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Distortion of the course of the normal folds of the ear and the appearance of supernumerary crura and folds.

Comment:
This is distinct from Stahl ear and Shell ear, with which the term has sometimes been conflated. The appearance often changes markedly after birth.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008551" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microtia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Underdevelopment of the external ear.

Comment:
The definitions of microtia follow a widely used, surgically based, classification of ear anomalies outlined by Weerda 1988. As microtia indicates at least both decreased length and width, and in more severe forms it includes abnormal shape of structures, all forms are acknowledged to be bundled terms, but are retained here because they are well established.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cryptotia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Invagination of the superior part of the auricle under a fold of temporal skin.

Comment:
There are associated anomalies of the upper antihelix and crura. The upper one-third of the auricle is primarily affected and there is an inferomedial displacement of the Helical Darwin tubercle. Two types are recognized. Type I: the antihelix and superior crus are reduced in size; type II: it is the antihelix and inferior crus that are affected.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000119" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the genitourinary system</a></h3>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000375" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of cochlea</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of the cochlea.

Comment:
The cochlea is an inner ear structure comprised of a snail-shell like structure divided into three fluid-filled parts. Two are canals for the transmission of pressure and in the third is the organ of Corti, which detects pressure impulses and responds with electrical impulses which travel along the auditory nerve to the brain.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011376" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Morphological abnormality of the vestibule of the inner ear</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A morphological abnormality of the vestibule, the central part of the osseous labyrinth that is situated medial to the tympanic cavity, behind the cochlea, and in front of the semicircular canals.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004467" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Preauricular pit</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Small indentation anterior to the insertion of the ear.

Comment:
Preauricular cysts and sinuses are ectodermal remnants from an aberrant development of the auditory tubercles, tend to be bilateral and are localized anterior to the tragus of the ear. The preauricular sinus is a benign congenital lesion of the preauricular soft tissue consisting of a blind-ending narrow tube or pit. It is also known as preauricular pit, preauricular fistula, preauricular tract and preauricular cyst. It can be asymptomatic or present as an infected and discharging sinus. It presents as a small pit adjacent to the external ear usually located at the anterior margin of the ascending limb of the helix. The preauricular sinus is variably also termed a preauricular pit, preauricular fistula, preauricular tract and preauricular cyst.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000400" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Macrotia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Median longitudinal ear length greater than two standard deviations above the mean and median ear width greater than two standard deviations above the mean (objective); or, apparent increase in length and width of the pinna (subjective).

Comment:
This is acknowledged to be a bundled term but retained here because of its usefulness in practice. Ear length is determined by the maximal distance from the superior aspect to the inferior aspect of the external ear. If only length is increased the term Long ear should be used.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000324" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Facial asymmetry</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormal difference between the left and right sides of the face.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011267" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microtia, third degree</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Presence of some auricular structures, but none of these structures conform to recognized ear components.

Comment:
This malformation is commonly associated with atresia of the external canal, but that anomaly should be coded separately. Complete absence of the ear should be coded as Anotia.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008569" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microtia, second degree</a></h3>
