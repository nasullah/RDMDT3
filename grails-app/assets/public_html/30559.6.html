						<!-- <h2>Monogenic diabetes eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
- Developmental disorder phenotype (e.g. CNS, renal or cardiac) AND<br />
- Diagnosis of diabetes <25 years AND<br />
- Not insulin dependent (>=3 years without insulin treatment) AND<br />
- Non-obese (BMI <30)

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
- One or more pancreatic autoantibodies (GAD, IA2, ICA) positive (titre >99th<br />
population centile)

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
 - MTTL1 testing<br />
- Other appropriate single gene tests as suggested by the phenotype,<br />
eg HNF1B if renal malformation, WFS1 if diabetes insipidus or optic<br />
atrophy, ALMS1 if obesity or cone-rod dystrophy<br />
- If the appropriate prior genetic testing is unclear, please go to www.diabetesgenes.org for further information, or consider carrying out a panel test of known diabetes genes.

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000819" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Diabetes mellitus</a></h3>
	A group of abnormalities characterized by hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000857" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neonatal insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001998" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neonatal hypoglycemia</a></h3>

	Body weight that is grossly above the acceptable or desirable weight, usually due to accumulation of excess fats in the body. The standards may vary with age, sex, genetic or cultural background. In the body mass index (BMI), a BMI greater than 30.0 kg/m2 is considered obese, and a BMI greater than 40.0 kg/m2 is considered morbidly obese.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003635" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue in limbs</a></h3>
	Loss (disappearance) of previously present subcutaneous fat tissue in arm or leg.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009064" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Generalized lipodystrophy</a></h3>

	A dermatosis characterized by thickened, hyperpigmented plaques, typically on the intertriginous surfaces and neck.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Acanthosis nigricans is seen in a variety of syndromes including those characterized by insulin resistance or fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) mutations, and may also occur as an adverse effect of several medications that promote hyperinsulinemia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012210" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal renal morphology</a></h3>
	Any structural anomaly of the kidney.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005562" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Multiple renal cysts</a></h3>
	The presence of many cysts in the kidney.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000119" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the genitourinary system</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000648" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Optic atrophy</a></h3>
	Atrophy of the optic nerve. Optic atrophy results from the death of the retinal ganglion cell axons that comprise the optic nerve and manifesting as a pale optic nerve on fundoscopy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The diagnosis of optic atrophy is made when the optic disc loses its normal orange-pink color. Optic atrophy is an end stage that arises from myriad causes of optic nerve damage anywhere along the path from the retina to the lateral geniculate. Some of the most common etiologies are advanced glaucoma, optic neuritis, arteritic or non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy or a compressive lesion.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000479" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the retina</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the retina.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008049" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the extraocular muscles</a></h3>
	An abnormality of an extraocular muscle.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
There are six extraocular muscles that control the movements of the eye.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000407" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sensorineural hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A type of hearing impairment  in one or both ears related to an abnormal functionality of the cochlear nerve.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />

	A myocardial disorder in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal, in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease and congenital heart disease sufficient to cause the observed myocardial abnormality.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002564" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Malformation of the heart and great vessels</a></h3>
	Congenital malformation of the heart or great vessels (i.e., the large blood vesslesentering and leaving the heart: aorta, the pulmonary arteries and veins, and the superior and inferior vena cava).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This category is meant to comprise congenital (developmental) structural heart defects.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002060" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the cerebrum</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the telencephalon, which is also known as the cerebrum.

	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003198" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Myopathy</a></h3>
	A disorder of muscle unrelated to impairment of innervation or neuromuscular junction.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The diagnosis of myopathy is often confirmed on the basis of myopathic changes in muscle biopsy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).

<br />
Comment:<br />
This term now covers many of the historical inexact descriptions such as Bird-like facies that probably should be avoided in modern genetics. This portion of the Ontology should be revised.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030057" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Autoimmune antibody positivity</a></h3>
	The presence of an antibody directed against the organism's own cells or tissues.

<br />
Comment:<br />
Deficiency of both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.
