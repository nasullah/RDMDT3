  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">A working or confirmed diagnosis of Classical Ehlers Danlos Syndrome</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Known genetic aetiology
Other forms of Ehlers Danlos syndrome</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice: 
 COL5A1, COL5A2</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000978" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Bruising susceptibility</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An ecchymosis (bruise) refers to the skin discoloration caused by the escape of blood into the tissues from ruptured blood vessels. This term refers to an abnormally increased susceptibility to bruising. The corresponding phenotypic abnormality is generally elicited on medical history as a report of frequent ecchymoses or bruising without adequate trauma.

Comment:
An ecchymosis is defined as being larger than 1 cm in size.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000974" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperextensible skin</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A condition in which the skin can be stretched beyond normal, and then returns to its initial position.

Comment:
Skin hyperelasticity is to be distinguished from cutis laxa, which refers to extra, redundant skin which tends to hang in folds.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001030" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Fragile skin</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Skin that splits easily with minimal injury.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001075" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Atrophic scars</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Scars that form a depression compared to the level of the surrounding skin because of damage to the collagen, fat or other tissues below the skin.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000993" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Molluscoid pseudotumors</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Bluish-grey, spongy nodules associated with scars over pressure points and easily traumatized areas like the elbows and knees.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001058" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Poor wound healing</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A reduced ability to heal cutaneous wounds.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001382" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Joint hypermobility</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The ability of a joint to move beyond its normal range of motion.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100790" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hernia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002650" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Scoliosis</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The presence of an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000286" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Epicanthus</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A fold of skin starting above the medial aspect of the upper eyelid and arching downward to cover, pass in front of and lateral to the medial canthus.

Comment:
In extreme cases, the skin fold can start as high as the eyebrow; this is called epicanthus superciliaris.</p>
