						<!-- <h2>Glaucoma Eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Diagnosis of developmental glaucoma confirmed (preferably) by an ophthalmologist with a sub-specialist expertise in childhood glaucoma <br />
- Availability of relevant phenotypic information including:<br />
  - structural assessment of anterior segment<br />
  - optic nerve head characteristics<br />
  - intraocular pressure at first presentation<br />
  - highest ever recorded IOP, where available<br />
  - slit lamp assessment of anterior segment<br />
  - pachymetry<br />
  - ERG and VEP (if appropriate)<br />
- Availability of non-ocular phenotypic information if appropriate:<br />
  - Presence/absence of maxillary hypoplasia<br />
  - umbilical anomaly<br />
  - cardiac anomalies (from history)<br />
  - growth delay <br />
  - dental anomalies<br />
  - metabolic disease (from history)

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Features of adult-onset glaucoma <br />
- Suggestion of secondary (acquired) glaucoma, i.e. following trauma, intraocular neoplasm, uveitis, lens-related (subluxation, spherophakia, phacolytic), following lensectomy, drug-induced (corticosteroids), secondary to rubeosis, angle closure, associated with increased venous pressure, or following intraocular infection.

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
- MYOC in cases of juvenile open angle glaucoma<br />
  - CYP1B1 in cases of primary congenital glaucoma<br />
  - PAX6 in cases of aniridia

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000501" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Glaucoma</a></h3>
	Glaucoma refers loss of retinal ganglion cells in a characteristic pattern of optic neuropathy usually associated with increased intraocular pressure.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The feature that differentiates glaucoma from other causes of visual morbidity is a characteristic pattern of damage to the optic nerve head. This is most easily recognised at the superior and inferior poles of the optic disc. The vertical cup:disc ratio (VCDR) has proved to be a simple, relatively robust index of glaucomatous loss of the neuroretinal rim. As with intraocular pressure, VCDR is a continuous variable within the population.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007854" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Glaucomatous visual field defect</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012108" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Primary open angle glaucoma</a></h3>
	A type of glaucoma with optic nerve damage in an eye with evidence of significant obstruction of the functional trabecular meshwork by the peripheral iris would be classified as having primary angle closure.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Evidence of optic nerve damage can include s optic disc abnormalities (Vertical cup:disc ratio over the 97. 5th percentile in the normal population), visual field defects. The role of increased intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma is debated, but an IOP exceeding the 99. 5th percentile of the normal population may be considered to support the diagnosis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000545" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Myopia</a></h3>
	An abnormality of refraction characterized by the ability to see objects nearby clearly, while objects in the distance appear blurry.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000505" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Visual impairment</a></h3>
	Visual impairment (or vision impairment) is vision loss (of a person) to such a degree as to qualify as an additional support need through a significant limitation of visual capability resulting from either disease, trauma, or congenital or degenerative conditions that cannot be corrected by conventional means, such as refractive correction, medication, or surgery.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007739" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Mildly reduced visual acuity</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0200068" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nonprogressive visual loss</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000529" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Progressive visual loss</a></h3>
	A reduction of previously attained ability to see.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007924" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Slow decrease in visual acuity</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012796" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Increased cup-to-disc ratio</a></h3>
	An elevation in the ratio of the diameter of the cup of the optic disc to the total diameter of the disc. The optic disc has an orange-pink rim with a pale centre (the cup) that does not contain neuroretinal tissue. An increase in this ratio therefoy may indicate a decrease in the quantity of healthy neuroretinal cells.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
A cup to disc ratio of 0.3 is generally considered normal. Note that the ratio is measured in the vertical orientation unless otherwise specified.
