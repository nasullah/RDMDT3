  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Patient with structural, preferably symmetrical radiological abnormalities on MR imaging affecting the striatum, globus pallidus and/or substantia nigra, AND
•	Neurological symptoms e.g. movement disorder</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Evidence of an acquired disorder (e.g. basal ganglia stroke or autoimmune aetiology)
•	No neurological symptoms
•	Known genetic cause</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:

- As dictated by phenotype</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormality of the basal ganglia.

Comment:
The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei (striatum, pallidum substantia nigra, and the subthalamic nucleus) at the base of the forebrain that are connected to the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, and other areas. The basal ganglia subserve motor functions that are distinct from those of the pyramidal (corticospinal) tract, for which reason neurologic abnormalities caused by lesions to the basal ganglia are often referred to as extrapyramidal.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of the globus pallidus.

Comment:
The globus pallidus is a cerebral nucleus located medially to the putamen and laterally to the internal capsule.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormality of the striatum (FMA:77618).

Comment:
The striatum (also known as the neostriatum or striate nucleus) contains the caudate nucleus and putamen, which are separated from one another by a white matter tract called the internal capsule. The striatum is part of the basal ganglia and receives input from the cerebral cortex.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.

Comment:
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.

Comment:
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001283" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Bulbar palsy</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Bulbar weakness (or bulbar palsy) refers to bilateral impairment of function of the lower cranial nerves IX, X, XI and XII, which occurs due to lower motor neuron lesion either at nuclear or fascicular level in the medulla or from bilateral lesions of the lower cranial nerves outside the brain-stem. Bulbar weakness is often associated with difficulty in chewing, weakness of the facial muscles, dysarthria, palatal weakness and regurgitation of fluids, dysphagia, and dysphonia.</p>
