						<!-- <h2>Severe multi-system atopic disease with high IgE Eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- All of the following are required:<br />
  - Adult patients only<br />
  - Onset of patients' medical problems is in early childhood (often < 1 year old)<br />
  - Severe persistent eczema (severe means requiring treatment over and above safe use of potent topical steroids, e.g. topical calcineurin inhibitors, UV light treatment or systemic immunosuppression: azathioprine, cyclosporine A, methotrexate, mycophenolate). Where topical calcineurin inhibitors are used as first line treatment and achieve good symptom control patients should only be included if serum IgE >10000.<br />
  - Recurrent or chronic S. aureus skin infections, but this criterion may be absent if the patient is receiving systemic immunosuppressive treatment.<br />
  - Asthma, but the severity can vary from mild to severe<br />
  - High IgE levels >5000<br />
  - Sensitised to a wide variety of aero-allergens and food allergens as measured by ImmunoCAP tests.

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Those with systemic infections (unlike patients with classical hyper IgE syndrome)

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005406" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent bacterial skin infections</a></h3>
	Increased susceptibility to bacterial infections of the skin, as manifested by recurrent episodes of infectious dermatitis.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Infectious dermatitis may manifest as impetigo, multiple purulent blisters, erythema, lymphadenopathy near the site of infection.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004429" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent viral infections</a></h3>
	Increased susceptibility to viral infections, as manifested by recurrent episodes of viral infection.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002718" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent bacterial infections</a></h3>
	Increased susceptibility to bacterial infections, as manifested by recurrent episodes of bacterial infection.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002841" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent fungal infections</a></h3>
	Increased susceptibility to fungal infections, as manifested by recurrent episodes of fungal infection.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012395" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seasonal allergy</a></h3>
	An allergy experienced at a particular time of year when trees or grasses pollinate and elicit an allergic reaction.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002257" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Chronic rhinitis</a></h3>
	Chronic inflammation of the nasal mucosa.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003193" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Allergic rhinitis</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002099" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Asthma</a></h3>
	Asthma is characterized by increased responsiveness of the tracheobronchial tree to multiple stimuli, leading to narrowing of the air passages with resultant dyspnea, cough, and wheezing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012393" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Allergy</a></h3>
	An allergy is an immune response or reaction to substances that are usually not harmful.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100327" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cow milk allergy</a></h3>
	Hypersensitivity in form of an adverse immune reaction against cow milk protein.
