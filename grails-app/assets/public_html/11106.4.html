	Muscular dystrophy affecting the muscles of the limb girdle (the hips and shoulders).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001270" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Motor delay</a></h3>
	A type of Developmental delay characterized by a delay in acquiring motor skills.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000478" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the eye</a></h3>
	Any abnormality of the eye, including location, spacing, and intraocular abnormalities.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000508" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ptosis</a></h3>
	The upper eyelid margin is positioned 3 mm or more lower than usual and covers the superior portion of the iris (objective); or, the upper lid margin obscures at least part of the pupil (subjective).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000501" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Glaucoma</a></h3>
	Glaucoma refers loss of retinal ganglion cells in a characteristic pattern of optic neuropathy usually associated with increased intraocular pressure.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The feature that differentiates glaucoma from other causes of visual morbidity is a characteristic pattern of damage to the optic nerve head. This is most easily recognised at the superior and inferior poles of the optic disc. The vertical cup:disc ratio (VCDR) has proved to be a simple, relatively robust index of glaucomatous loss of the neuroretinal rim. As with intraocular pressure, VCDR is a continuous variable within the population.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000597" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ophthalmoparesis</a></h3>
	Ophthalmoplegia is a paralysis or weakness of one or more of the muscles that control eye movement.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000648" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Optic atrophy</a></h3>
	Atrophy of the optic nerve. Optic atrophy results from the death of the retinal ganglion cell axons that comprise the optic nerve and manifesting as a pale optic nerve on fundoscopy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The diagnosis of optic atrophy is made when the optic disc loses its normal orange-pink color. Optic atrophy is an end stage that arises from myriad causes of optic nerve damage anywhere along the path from the retina to the lateral geniculate. Some of the most common etiologies are advanced glaucoma, optic neuritis, arteritic or non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy or a compressive lesion.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000639" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nystagmus</a></h3>
	Rhythmic, involuntary oscillations of one or both eyes related to abnormality in fixation, conjugate gaze, or vestibular mechanisms.

<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).

	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.

	Chronic loss of joint motion in a finger due to structural changes in non-bony tissue.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that the term camptodactyly refers to a painless flexion contracture of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint and not to a finger joint contracture in general.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001324" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Muscle weakness</a></h3>
	Reduced strength of muscles.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
It is important clinical to distinguish between muscle weakness, fatigue, and asthenia. Fatigue describes the inability to continue performing a task after multiple repetitions; in contrast, a patient with primary weakness is unable to perform the first repetition of the task. Asthenia is a sense of weariness or exhaustion in the absence of muscle weakness. Conditions that result in intrinsic muscle weakness can be divided into several main categories: infectious, neurologic, endocrine, inflammatory, rheumatologic, genetic, metabolic, electrolyte-induced, or drug-induced.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003323" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Progressive muscle weakness</a></h3>

	An impairment in the ability to produce voice sounds.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003473" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Fatigable weakness</a></h3>
	A type of weakness that occurs after a muscle group is used and lessens if the muscle group has some rest. That is, there is diminution of strength with repetitive muscle actions.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This type of weakness is pathognomonic for an abnormality of the neuromuscular junction such as myasthenia gravis. A characteristic form of muscular weakness that worsens after use of affected muscles. Myasthenia is caused by  failure of neuromuscular transmission, which results from the binding of autoantibodies to proteins involved in signaling at the neuromuscular junction, including especially the nicotinic acetyl choline receptor (AChR) or, less frequently, a muscle-specific tyrosine kinase involved in AChR clustering.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003474" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sensory impairment</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the primary sensation that is mediated by peripheral nerves (pain, temperature, touch, vibration, joint position). The word hypoesthesia (or hyesthesia) refers to a reduction in cutaneous sensation to a specific type of testing.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term does not include abnormalities of cortical sensation such as two-point discrimination, stereognosis, and graphesthesia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002505" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Progressive inability to walk</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002355" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Difficulty walking</a></h3>
	Reduced ability to walk (ambulate).

	Abnormal results of investigations using electromyography (EMG).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003458" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: myopathic abnormalities</a></h3>
	The presence of abnormal electromyographic patterns indicative of myopathy, such as small-short polyphasic motor unit potentials.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003445" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: neuropathic changes</a></h3>
	The presence of characteristic findings of denervation on electromyography (fibrillations, positive sharp waves, and giant motor unit potentials).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This is a bundled term. It is preferable to annotate the precise clinical observations, but the term is kept now for convenience.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100283" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: continuous motor unit activity at rest</a></h3>
	Continuous electromyographic activity of motor units at rest, i.e., without voluntary movement of the muscles.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The motor unit contains an anterior horn cell, its axon, and all of the muscle fibers that it innervates via the neuromuscular junction. Note that a healthy relaxed muscle does not show significant EMG activity at rest.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003730" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: myotonic runs</a></h3>
	Spontaneous, repetitive electrical activity demonstrated by electromyography (EMG).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This is a characteristic abnormality seen in the myotonias and periodic paralyses.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010546" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Muscle fibrillation</a></h3>
	Fine, rapid twitching of individual muscle fibers with little or no movement of the muscle as a whole. If a motor neuron or its axon is destroyed, the muscle fibers it innervates undergo denervation atrophy. This leads to hypersensitivity of individual muscle fibers to acetyl choline so that they may contract spontaneously. Isolated activity of individual muscle fibers is generally so fine it cannot be seen through the intact skin, although it can be recorded as a short-duration spike in the EMG.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007002" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Motor axonal neuropathy</a></h3>
	Progressive impairment of function of motor axons with muscle weakness, atrophy, and cramps. The deficits are length-dependent, meaning that muscles innervated by the longest nerves are affected first, so that for instance the arms are affected at a later age than the onset of deficits involving the lower leg.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Distal motor neuropathy is a bundled term that should not be used if more detailed information about the phenotype is available.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007220" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Demyelinating motor neuropathy</a></h3>
	Demyelination of peripheral motor nerves.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Demyelinating motor neuropathy demonstrates slow motor nerve conduction velocities with reduced amplitudes of motor nerve conduction and prolonged distal latencies.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003448" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Decreased sensory nerve conduction velocity</a></h3>
	Reduced speed of conduction of the action potential along a sensory nerve.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) in response to electrical stimulation is recorded from the nerve itself by means of dermal recording electrodes. The SNAP is the sum of all the action potentials generated in sensory nerve fibres by the applied electrical impulse.

	Myofibrillar structural changes characterized by abnormal intracellular accumulation of the intermediate filament desmin and other proteins.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This feature is demonstrated by muscle biopsy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030112" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal muscle fiber alpha dystroglycan</a></h3>
	A deviation from normal of muscle alpha-dystroglcan expression. Alpha-dystroglycan is a heavily glycosylated peripheral-membrane component of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DAPC), which, in addition to laminin alpha2, binds perlecan and agrin in the extracellular matrix, whereas beta-dystroglycan, derived from the same gene, is a transmembrane protein that links to dystrophin intracellularly.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030119" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal muscle fiber calpain-3</a></h3>
	A deviation from normal in the amount of calpain-3 in muscle tissue. Calpains are intracellular nonlysosomal cysteine proteases modulated by calcium ions. A typical calpain is a heterodimer composed of two distinct subunits, one large (over 80 kDa) and the other small (30 kDa). While only one gene encoding the small subunit has been demonstrated, there are many genes for the large one. CAPN3 is similar to ubiquitous Calpain 1 and 2 (m-calpain and micro-calpain), but contains specific insertion sequences (NS, IS1 and IS2). Calpains cleave target proteins to modify their properties, rather than breaking down the substrates.
