  <p class="preserve-new-lines">NB. Clinical test guidance:
General biopsy refers to biopsy of abnormal intestinal features 
Inflammatory markers refers to C reactive protein 
General Imaging Diagnostics refers to Endoscopy</p>

  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Proven histological evidence of epithelial disorder on gut biopsy: Epithelial dysmorphology characterised by e.g. epithelial detachment abnormal epithelial cell polarisation, epithelial cell crowding/tufting and increased apoptotic activity of the epithelial layer.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Evidence of primary immune deficiency. 
•	Histopathology in keeping with conventional GI disorders such as IBD without features described above.</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 •	EPCAM, MYO5B, ADAM17, IKBKG</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001508" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Failure to thrive</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Failure to thrive (FTT) refers to a child whose physical growth is substantially below the norm.

Comment:
Although there is no clear consensus on the exact definition of FTT, it is usually diagnoses in a child growing below the 3rd percentile or in a child whose decreased growth has cross two major growth percentiles (for example, from above the 75th percentile to below the 25th percentile).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001510" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Growth delay</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A deficiency or slowing down of growth pre- and postnatally.

Comment:
Poor or abnormally slow gains in weight or height in a child.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001561" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Polyhydramnios</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The presence of excess amniotic fluid in the uterus during pregnancy.

Comment:
Polyhydramnios is diagnosed if the deepest vertical pool of amniotic fluid is more than 8 cm or amniotic fluid index is more than 95th percentile for the corresponding gestational age.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002041" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intractable diarrhea</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003270" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abdominal distention</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Distention of the abdomen.

Comment:
Abdominal distention can be a secondary feature associated with a number of conditions such as bowel obstruction.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002243" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Protein-losing enteropathy</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormal loss of protein from the digestive tract related to excessive leakage of plasma proteins into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract.

Comment:
Affected individuals may present with peripheral edema, diarrhea with or without bleeding, abdominal pain, and/or weight loss. Protein-losing enteropathy is not a disease but is a manifestation of a number of gastrointestinal diseases and can be related to factors such as lymphatic obstruction, mucosal disease with erosions, ulcerations, or increased mucosal permeability to proteins.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002037" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Inflammation of the large intestine</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004387" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Enterocolitis</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An inflammation of the colon and small intestine. However, most conditions are either categorized as Enteritis (inflammation of the small intestine) or Colitis (inflammation of the large intestine).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002027" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abdominal pain</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An unpleasant sensation characterized by physical discomfort (such as pricking, throbbing, or aching) and perceived to originate in the abdomen.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011100" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intestinal atresia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormal closure, or atresia of the tubular structure of the intestine.

Comment:
Intestinal atresia is a broad term used to describe a complete blockage or obstruction anywhere in the intestine, in contrast to stenosis, which refers to a partial obstruction that results in a narrowing of the intestinal lumen.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A abnormal increase in the inflammatory response to injury or infection.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003203" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Negative nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction test</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">In the NBT test, neutrophils change the colorless compound NBT into a compound with a deep blue color. If this test is negative (i.e., no blue color is produced), then this indicates a defect in superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase activity with inability to efficiently kill phagocytized bacteria.

Comment:
The NBT test measures the ability of neutrophils to convert nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), to a deep blue color. This test can be abnormal in chronic granulomatous disease.</p>
