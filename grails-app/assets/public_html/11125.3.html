						<!-- <h2>Multiple Epiphyseal Dysplasia Eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
    <br />
<br />
- Radiological evidence of MED, as determined by expert skeletal dysplasia radiologist<br />
- Clinical manifestations of MED within this context, including mild short stature, genu valgum/varum, joint hypermobility +/- brachydactyly.

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Genome-wide copy number variation testing (e.g. aCGH, SNP array or other genomic microarray) showing a chromosome imbalance indicating an alternative aetiology<br />
- MED as a feature of another skeletal dysplasia condition e.g. spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
- Genome-wide copy number variation testing (e.g. aCGH, SNP array or other genomic microarray)<br />
  - COMP (if appropriate)

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

						<!-- <h2>Multiple Epiphyseal Dysplasia Phenotypes</h2> -->

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003502" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Mild short stature</a></h3>
	A mild degree of short stature, more than -2 SD but not more than -3 SD from mean corrected for age and sex.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003498" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Disproportionate short stature</a></h3>
	A kind of short stature in which different regions of the body are shortened to differing extents.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001382" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Joint hypermobility</a></h3>
	The ability of a joint to move beyond its normal range of motion.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001156" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Brachydactyly syndrome</a></h3>
	Digits that appear disproportionately short compared to the hand/foot. The word brachydactyly is used to describe a series of Mendelian diseases characterized by distinct patterns of shortened digits (brachydactyly types A-E). This is the sense used here, however, it is preferable to described the observed phenotypic abnormalities precisely.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001831" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short toe</a></h3>
	A toe that appears disproportionately short compared to the foot.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding must be distinguished from digits that are of increased girth but of normal length and that of a long mid- and hind foot with normal digit lengths. The affected digits should be specified as described in the introductory comments. Note that we designate brachydactyly as a synonym, but this use of the term is distinct from the use of the same word in Bell's classification of brachdactyly.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009381" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short finger</a></h3>
	Abnormally short finger associated with developmental hypoplasia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001288" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Gait disturbance</a></h3>
	The term gait disturbance can refer to any disruption of the ability to walk. In general, this can refer to neurological diseases but also fractures or other sources of pain that is triggered upon walking. However, in the current context gait disturbance refers to difficulty walking on the basis of a neurological or muscular disease.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
If possible, this term should not be used for new annotations. Rather, a more specific term should be sought.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002970" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Genu varum</a></h3>
	A positional abnormality marked by outward bowing of the legs in which the knees stay wide apart when a person stands with the feet and ankles together.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002857" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Genu valgum</a></h3>
	The legs angle inward, such that the knees are close together and the ankles far apart.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002829" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Arthralgia</a></h3>
	Joint pain.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003088" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Premature osteoarthritis</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003418" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Back pain</a></h3>
	An unpleasant sensation characterized by physical discomfort (such as pricking, throbbing, or aching) localized to the back.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011849" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal bone ossification</a></h3>
	Any anomaly in the formation of bone or of a bony substance, or the conversion of fibrous tissue or of cartilage into bone or a bony substance.
