	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009731" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebral hamartomata</a></h3>
	The presence of a hamartoma of the cerebrum.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hamartomatous lesions (benign focal lesions composed of disorganized tissue elements) affecting and sometimes originating from the cerebrum.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002858" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Meningioma</a></h3>
	The presence of a meningioma, i.e., a benign tumor originating from the dura mater or arachnoid mater.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100008" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Schwannoma</a></h3>
	A benign nerve sheath tumor composed of Schwann cells.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Glial cells are cells that support nerve cells. Schwann cells wrap around the axon to form the myelin sheath. Schwann cells are involved in many important aspects of peripheral nerve biology; the conduction of nervous impulses along axons, nerve development and regeneration, trophic support for neurons, production of the nerve extracellular matrix and presentation of antigens to T-lymphocytes. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), Guillain-Barr?? syndrome (GBS), schwannomatosis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) are all neuropathies involving Schwann cells.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000256" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Macrocephaly</a></h3>
	Occipitofrontal (head) circumference greater than 97th centile compared to appropriate, age matched, sex-matched normal standards. Alternatively, a apparently increased size of the cranium.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far above the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Macrocephaly is an absolute term. The term relative macrocephaly can be used when the head size centile exceeds the centile for height, for example, head size at the 75th centile with height at the 5th centile for age and sex.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010610" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Palmar pits</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010612" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Plantar pits</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010603" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Keratocystic odontogenic tumor</a></h3>
	A benign uni- or multicystic, intraosseous tumor of odontogenic origin, with a characteristic lining of parakeratinized stratified squamous epithelium and potential for aggressive, infiltrative behaviour.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT) most commonly affects the mandible, but may also be localized in the maxilla.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005462" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Calcification of falx cerebri</a></h3>
	The presence of calcium deposition in the falx cerebri.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000892" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Bifid ribs</a></h3>
	A bifid rib refers to cleavage of the sternal end of a rib, usually unilateral. Bifid ribs are usually asymptomatic, and are often discovered incidentally by chest x-ray.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000360" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Tinnitus</a></h3>
	Tinnitus is an auditory perception that can be described as the experience of sound, in the ear or in the head, in the absence of external acoustic stimulation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009830" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Peripheral neuropathy</a></h3>
	Peripheral neuropathy is a general term for any disorder of the peripheral nervous system. The main clinical features used to classify peripheral neuropathy are distribution, type (mainly demyelinating versus mainly axonal), duration, and course.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001251" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ataxia</a></h3>
	Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- oder overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Ataxia can be differentiated into dyssynergy, asynergy, dysmetria (hypometria, hypermetria), dysdiadochokinesis, gait ataxia, truncal ataxia, limb ataxia, and dysarthria). Note: This term does not include sensory ataxia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000238" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hydrocephalus</a></h3>
	Hydrocephalus is an active distension of the ventricular system of the brain resulting from inadequate passage of CSF from its point of production within the cerebral ventricles to its point of absorption into the systemic circulation.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hydrocephalus results from an imbalance between the rate of production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), mainly in the choroid plexus, and its reabsorption in the subarchnoid space over brain and spinal cord.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002410" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Aqueductal stenosis</a></h3>
	Stenosis of the cerebral aqueduct (also known as the mesencephalic duct, aqueductus mesencephali, or aqueduct of Sylvius), which connects the third cerebral ventricle in the diencephalon to the fourth ventricle, which is between the pons and cerebellum.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100014" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Epiretinal membrane</a></h3>
	An epiretinal membrane is a thin sheet of fibrous tissue that can develop on the surface of the macular area of the retina and cause a disturbance in vision. An epiretinal membrane area can develop on the thin macular area of the retin. An epiretinal membrane is also sometimes called a macular pucker, premacular fibrosis, surface wrinkling retinopathy or cellophane maculopathy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000501" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Glaucoma</a></h3>
	Glaucoma refers loss of retinal ganglion cells in a characteristic pattern of optic neuropathy usually associated with increased intraocular pressure.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The feature that differentiates glaucoma from other causes of visual morbidity is a characteristic pattern of damage to the optic nerve head. This is most easily recognised at the superior and inferior poles of the optic disc. The vertical cup:disc ratio (VCDR) has proved to be a simple, relatively robust index of glaucomatous loss of the neuroretinal rim. As with intraocular pressure, VCDR is a continuous variable within the population.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009594" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Retinal hamartoma</a></h3>
	A hamartoma (a benign, focal malformation consisting of a disorganized mixture of cells and tissues) of the retina.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009737" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Lisch nodules</a></h3>
	The presence of pigmented, oval and dome-shaped raised hamartomatous nevi of the iris..
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000957" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cafe-au-lait spot</a></h3>
	Cafe-au-lait spots are hyperpigmented lesions that can vary in color from light brown to dark brown with smooth borders and having a size of 1.5 cm or more in adults and 0.5 cm or more in children.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The phrase cafe-au-lait comes from the French word for milk-coffee. A single cafe-au-lait spot can be an isolated finding in otherwise normal individuals. Multiple cafe-au-lait spots often indicate the presence of neurofibromatosis type 1 but may also be seen in other diseases including McCune-Albright syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Fanconi anemia.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000729" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Autistic behavior</a></h3>
	A disorder beginning in childhood. It is marked by the presence of markedly abnormal or impaired development in social interaction and communication and a markedly restricted repertoire of activity and interest. Manifestations of the disorder vary greatly depending on the developmental level and chronological age of the individual (DSM-IV).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term can be used to refer to autism spectrum disorder as a phenotypic feature that can be a component of a disease. Autism spectrum disorder range from a severe form, called autistic disorder, to a milder form, Asperger syndrome.
