<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
- Congenital cataracts, or cataracts diagnosed in childhood  <br />
- Bilaterally affected individuals <br />
- Isolated or complex

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>


<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
 

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000505" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Visual impairment</a></h3>
	Visual impairment (or vision impairment) is vision loss (of a person) to such a degree as to qualify as an additional support need through a significant limitation of visual capability resulting from either disease, trauma, or congenital or degenerative conditions that cannot be corrected by conventional means, such as refractive correction, medication, or surgery.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cataract</a></h3>
	A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007834" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Progressive cataract</a></h3>
	A kind of cataract that progresses with age.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010700" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Total cataract</a></h3>
	A Congenital cataract characterized by an opacity of all the fibers of a lens.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100018" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nuclear cataract</a></h3>
	A nuclear cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the lens nucleus. That is, a nuclear cataract is one that is located in the center of the lens. The nucleus tends to darken changing from clear to yellow and sometimes brown.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100019" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cortical cataract</a></h3>
	A cataract which affects the layer of the lens surrounding the nucleus, i.e., the lens cortex. It is identified by its unique wedge or spoke appearance.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010922" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Membranous cataract</a></h3>
	A form of cataract in which the lens substance has shrunk, leaving a collapsed, flattened capsule with little or no cortex or epithelium on the lens.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010696" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Polar cataract</a></h3>
	A type of Congenital cataract in which the opacities occupy the subcapsular cortex at the anterior or posterior pole of the lens.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000523" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Subcapsular cataract</a></h3>
	A cataract that affects the region of the lens directly beneath the capsule of the lens.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007971" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Lamellar cataract</a></h3>
	A congenital cataract in which opacity is limited to layers of the lens external to the nucleus (i.e., the perinuclear region), i.e., between the nuclear and cortical layers of the lens.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010693" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pulverulent Cataract</a></h3>
	A kind of congenital cataract that is characterized by a hollow sphere of punctate opacities involving the fetal nucleus and that usually occurs bilaterally.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The word "pulverulent " means dust-like and refers to the dustlike appearance of the punctate opacities in this type of cataract. The word pulverulent refers to the very small size of the punctate opacities (like flecks of dust) rather than to a dust-like color.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000568" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microphthalmos</a></h3>
	A developmental anomaly characterized by abnormal smallness of one or both eyes.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000482" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcornea</a></h3>
	A congenital abnormality of the cornea in which the cornea and the anterior segment of the eye are smaller than normal. The horizontal diameter of the cornea does not reach 10 mm even in adulthood.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that the cornea's diameter is normally about 9.5-10.0 mm at birth and reaches 10.0-12-5 mm in adulthood.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012376" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microphakia</a></h3>
	Abnormal smallness of the lens.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004328" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the anterior segment of the eye</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the anterior segment of the eye.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The anterior segment comprises the structures in front of the vitreous humour: the cornea, iris, ciliary body, and lens.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007700" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anterior segment dysgenesis</a></h3>
	Abnormal development (dysgenesis) of the anterior segment of the eye globe. These structures are mainly of mesenchymal origin.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
In anterior segment mesenchymal ocular dysgenesis (ASMOD), multiple tissues are affected, including the iris, cornea, and lens as well as the Schlemm's canal and trabecular meshwork drainage structures located at the anterior segment angle where the iris and cornea meet. These abnormalities may result from a primary defect in the migration and/or differentiation of the mesenchymal cells that contribute to development of the cornea, iris, and drainage structures.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004329" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the posterior segment of the eye</a></h3>
	The posterior segment comprises the anterior hyaloid membrane and all of the optical structures behind it: the vitreous humor, retina, choroid, and optic nerve.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007968" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous</a></h3>
	A failure of regression of the hyaloid vessel, which supplies the primary vitreous during embryogenesis and normally regresses in the third trimester of pregnancy, leading to a particular form of posterior cataract. This condition is known as Persistent Hyperplastic Primary Vitreous (PHPV).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000546" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Retinal degeneration</a></h3>
	A deterioration of the retina. This nonspecific term is retained here because of its wide use in the literature, but if possible new annotations should indicate the precise type of retinal abnormality.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011438" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Maternal teratogenic exposure</a></h3>
	A medical history of exposure of the mother of a child or fetus to a teratogenic substance during pregnancy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Commonly encountered maternal teratogens include alcohol, antiepileptic drugs, antihypertensive and antithyroid medications, aspirin, bisphosphonates, chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, ionizing radiation, recreational drugs, and serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (a class of antidepressants).
