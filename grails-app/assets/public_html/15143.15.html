  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- CDP reported by skeletal dysplasia expert and/or radiologist
- Radiological features of a CDP condition, as determined by skeletal dysplasia expert, after stippling would be expected to have resolved (after 2nd birthday usually), e.g. rhizomelia, remnants of vertebral body clefting, short tibiae and metacarpals
- Biochemical evidence of abnormal metabolism, i.e. VLCFA profile, abnormal cholesterol biosynthesis, abnormal arylsulphatase E</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Maternal factors excluded (i.e. Mixed connective tissue disease, Hyperemesis gravidarum, fetal exposure to warfarin)
- Radiology not consistent
- Genome-wide copy number variation testing (e.g. aCGH, SNP array or other genomic microarray) demonstrating an imbalance that explains the condition</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 - Genome-wide copy number variation testing (e.g. aCGH, SNP array or other genomic microarray)</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003498" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Disproportionate short stature</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A kind of short stature in which different regions of the body are shortened to differing extents.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001156" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Brachydactyly syndrome</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Digits that appear disproportionately short compared to the hand/foot. The word brachydactyly is used to describe a series of Mendelian diseases characterized by distinct patterns of shortened digits (brachydactyly types A-E). This is the sense used here, however, it is preferable to described the observed phenotypic abnormalities precisely.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003027" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Mesomelia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Shortening of the middle parts of the limbs (forearm and lower leg) in relation to the upper and terminal segments.

Comment:
Shortening of the limbs where the predominant shortness is in the middle bones.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.

Comment:
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009381" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short finger</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormally short finger associated with developmental hypoplasia.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009882" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short distal phalanx of finger</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Short distance from the end of the finger to the most distal interphalangeal crease or the distal interphalangeal joint flexion point. That is, hypoplasia of one or more of the distal phalanx of finger.

Comment:
This term differs from Partial absence of the finger because in that term, the phalanx must be missing, whereas in this term it may be small, but present. Distal phalangeal lengths can be assessed subjectively by comparing that digit segment to the rest of the digit, to other normal digits in that patient, or to typical patients of that age or build. Regarding the subjective definition, for individuals who do not have flexion creases, one may determine this by flexing the DIP joint and estimating the length of the terminal segment of the digit. Alternatively, one may be able to palpate the joint.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010049" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short metacarpal</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Diminished length of one or more metacarpal bones in relation to the others of the same hand or to the contralateral metacarpal.

Comment:
Short metacarpals can involve any of the metacarpal bones, and the affected ray should be specified. The assessment of isolated short metacarpal can be made by viewing the dorsum of the hand when clenched. Note that if metacarpals F2-5 are affected, the correct term is Short palm.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001831" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short toe</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A toe that appears disproportionately short compared to the foot.

Comment:
This finding must be distinguished from digits that are of increased girth but of normal length and that of a long mid- and hind foot with normal digit lengths. The affected digits should be specified as described in the introductory comments. Note that we designate brachydactyly as a synonym, but this use of the term is distinct from the use of the same word in Bell&#39;s classification of brachdactyly.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001857" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short distal phalanx of toe</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Short distance from the end of the toe to the most distal interphalangeal crease or distal interphalangeal joint flexion point, i.e., abnormally short distal phalanx of toe.

Comment:
This term differs from Partial absence of the toe because in that term the phalanx must be missing, whereas here it may be small, but present. Relative shortening of the distal phalanges of the toes can be harder to assess than in the fingers, as they are normally quite short. Distal phalangeal lengths can be assessed subjectively by comparing that digit segment to the rest of the digit, to other normal digits in that patient, or to typical patients of that age or build.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001371" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Flexion contracture</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A flexion contracture is a bent (flexed) joint that cannot be straightened actively or passively. It is thus a chronic loss of joint motion due to structural changes in muscle, tendons, ligaments, or skin that prevents normal movement of joints.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001883" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Talipes</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A deformity of foot and ankle that has different subtypes that are talipes equinovarus, talipes equinovalgus, talipes calcaneovarus and talipes calcaneovalgus.

Comment:
Talipes means (a deformity of) foot and ankle. There are four types of talipes.
1) Talipes equinovarus - the foot is pointing inwards and down (the most common form)
2) Talipes equinovalgus - where the foot points outwards and down
3) Talipes calcaneovarus - where the foot points inwards and up
4) Talipes calcaneovalgus - where the foot points inwards and down.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001382" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Joint hypermobility</a></h3>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.

Comment:
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.

Comment:
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001276" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypertonia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A condition in which there is increased muscle tone so that arms or legs, for example, are stiff and difficult to move.  

Comment:
Spasticity is a term that is often used interchangeably with hypertonia.  Spasticity, however, is a particular type of hypertonia in which the muscles&#39; spasms are increased by movement.  In this type, patients usually have exaggerated reflex responses.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011800" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Midface retrusion</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Posterior positions and/or vertical shortening of the infraorbital and perialar regions, or increased concavity of the face and/or reduced nasolabial angle.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000272" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Malar flattening</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Underdevelopment of the malar (frontal) process of the maxilla, appreciated in profile and/or by palpation.

Comment:
The malar process is the most medial and superior portion of the maxilla, contiguous with the lateral boundary of the nasal bridge. The term malar hypoplasia is no longer preferred because surface examination cannot distinguish hypoplasia from hypotrophy.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005280" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Depressed nasal bridge</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Posterior positioning of the nasal root in relation to the overall facial profile for age.

Comment:
The adjective &quot;depressed&quot; here does not indicate an active process but a status. A depressed nasal bridge can occur irrespective of the width of the nasal bridge, and the width should be assessed independently. In infancy, the nasal bridge is relatively more posterior than in the older person. The term depressed nasal bridge should only be used when the bridge is more posterior than is typical for age and ethnic background.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003196" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short nose</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Distance from nasion to subnasale more than two standard deviations below the mean, or alternatively, an apparently decreased length from the nasal root to the nasal tip.

Comment:
Note: a small nose has both decreased height and a decreased width. These should be coded separately.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000430" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Underdeveloped nasal alae</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Thinned, deficient, or excessively arched ala nasi.

Comment:
The alae nasi are the lateral portions of the nose or the wings of the nostrils, which partly encircle the nostrils (nares). They are usually about the width of the columella, but vary greatly depending on the shape of the nostril. Note that individuals may be described as having a Cleft ala nasi, but have a severely underdeveloped ala nasi. In an underdeveloped ala the continuity of the tissue encircling the nostril is undisturbed while in a cleft it is disrupted. With severe hypoplasia of the nasal alae, the nasal tip may appear depressed.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000204" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft upper lip</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A gap in the upper lip. This is a congenital defect resulting from nonfusion of tissues of the lip during embryonal development.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cataract</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.

Comment:
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000587" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the optic nerve</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormality of the optic nerve.

Comment:
The optic nerve, which is also known as cranial nerve II, transmits visual information from the retina to the brain. The term &#39;optic disc&#39; is frequently used to describe the portion of the optic nerve clinically visible on fundoscopic examination.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000958" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dry skin</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Skin characterized by the lack of natural or normal moisture.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000962" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperkeratosis</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Hyperkeratosis is thickening of the outer layer of the skin, the stratum corneum, which is composed of large, polyhedral, plate-like envelopes filled with keratin which are the dead cells that have migrated up from the stratum granulosum.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008064" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ichthyosis</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of the skin characterized the presence of excessive amounts of dry surface scales on the skin resulting from an abnormality of keratinization.

Comment:
The ichthyoses are a group of skin diseases characterized by drying and scaling of skin with the accumulation of thick scales and cracks that may be painful or bleed. The abnormality in ichthyosis lies in am imbalance in the normal lifecycle of skin in which growth is matched with dying and shedding of skin cells. In ichthyosis, skin cells reproduce at a rate faster than dead skin cells can be shed or reproduce at a normal rate with a reduction in the rate of shedding. Either abnormality leads to a build up of dry and scaly skin. Note that this term refers to the morphological abnormality of the skin and not the disorder.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001019" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Erythroderma</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An inflammatory exfoliative dermatosis involving nearly all of the surface of the skin. Erythroderma develops suddenly. A patchy erythema may generalize and spread to affect most of the skin. Scaling may appear in 2-6 days and be accompanied by hot, red, dry skin, malaise, and fever.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">In utero, the ductus arteriosus (DA) serves to divert ventricular output away from the lungs and toward the placenta by connecting the main pulmonary artery to the descending aorta. A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in the first 3 days of life is a physiologic shunt in healthy term and preterm newborn infants, and normally is substantially closed within about 24 hours after bith and completely closed after about three weeks. Failure of physiologcal closure is referred to a persistent or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Depending on the degree of left-to-right shunting, PDA can have clinical consequences.</p>

Comment:
Phytanic acid (3,7,11,15-tetramethyl hexadecanoic acid) is a fatty acid that is derived from chlorophyll and present in the diet. The metabolism of phytanic acid involves alpha-oxidation in the peroxisome, which converts phytanic acid to pristanic acid. Peroxisomes involved in the catabolism of very long chain fatty acids and phytanic acid. Peroxisomal malfunctioning can lead to over-accumulation of very long chain fatty acids and phytanic acid, among other things.</p>
