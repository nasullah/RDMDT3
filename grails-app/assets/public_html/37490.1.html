	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100280" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Crohn&#39;s disease</a></h3>
	A chronic granulomatous inflammatory disease of the intestines that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus, causing a wide variety of symptoms. It primarily causes abdominal pain, diarrhea which may be bloody, vomiting, or weight loss, but may also cause complications outside of the gastrointestinal tract such as skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, tiredness, and lack of concentration. Crohn's disease is thought to be an autoimmune disease, in which the body's immune system attacks the gastrointestinal tract, causing inflammation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012220" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Non-caseating epithelioid cell granulomatosis</a></h3>
	The presence of multiple epithelioid cell granulomas consist of highly differentiated mononuclear phagocytes (epithelioid cells and giant cells) and lymphocytes, not exhibiting caseation (a form of necrosis in which the tissue changes into a dry, amorphous mass said to resemble cheese).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This feature is a hallmark of sarcoidosis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100279" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ulcerative colitis</a></h3>
	A chronic inflammatory bowel disease that includes characteristic ulcers, or open sores, in the colon. The main symptom of active disease is usually constant diarrhea mixed with blood, of gradual onset and intermittent periods of exacerbated symptoms contrasting with periods that are relatively symptom-free. In contrast to Crohn's disease this special form of colitis begins in the distal parts of the rectum, spreads continually upwards and affects only mucose and submucose tissue of the colon.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009789" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Perianal abscess</a></h3>
	The presence of an abscess located around the anus.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100819" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intestinal fistula</a></h3>
	An abnormal connection between the gut and another hollow organ, such as the bladder, urethra, vagina, or other regions of the gastrointestinal tract.

	Blockage or impairment of the normal flow of the contents of the intestine towards the anal canal.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005234" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neonatal intestinal obstruction</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011355" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Localized skin lesion</a></h3>
	A lesion of the skin that is located in a specific region rather than being generalized.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002719" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent infections</a></h3>
	Increased susceptibility to microbial infections, as manifested by recurrent episodes of infection.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001945" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Fever</a></h3>
	Elevated body temperature due to failed thermoregulation.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hyperthermia is defined as a temperature greater than 37.5-38.3 ??C (100-101 ??F).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001744" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Splenomegaly</a></h3>
	Abnormal increased size of the spleen.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002716" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Lymphadenopathy</a></h3>

<br />
Comment:<br />
Hemophagocytosis is a nonspecific phenotypic feature observed in several conditions including hemolytic anemia, malignant disease, infections, and hemophagocytic syndrome (also known as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a rare hyperinflammatory syndrome caused by severe hypercytokinemia due to a highly stimulated but ineffective immune process).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001875" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neutropenia</a></h3>

Comment:<br />
Mild neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil cont between 1000 and 1500 cells per microliter, moderte as between 500 and 100, and severe as less than 500 cells.

	An anomaly of the natural killer cell, which is a lymphocyte that can spontaneously kill a variety of target cells without prior antigenic activation via germline encoded activation receptors and also regulate immune responses via cytokine release and direct contact with other cells.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004313" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypogammaglobulinemia</a></h3>
	An abnormally decreased level of immunoglobulin in blood.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
In humans, immunoglobulins comprise the five antibody isotypes IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM.

	An abnormal susceptibility to bleeding, often referred to as a bleeding diathesis. A bleeding diathesis may be related to vascular, platelet and coagulation defects.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term is kept for historical reasons. If possible, a more exact description of the phenotype (i.e., whether there is a vascular, platelet and coagulation defect) should be attempted.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002664" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neoplasm</a></h3>
	An organ or organ-system abnormality that consists of uncontrolled autonomous cell-proliferation which can occur in any part of the body as a benign or malignant neoplasm (tumour).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies neoplasms into four main groups: (i) benign neoplasm, (ii) in situ neoplasm, (iii) malignant neoplasm, and (iv) neoplasm of uncertain or unknown behavior. A malignant neoplasm is also known as cancer.
