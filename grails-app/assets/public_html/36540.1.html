	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008066" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal blistering of the skin</a></h3>
	The presence of one or more bullae on the skin, defined as fluid-filled blisters more than 5 mm in diameter with thin walls.<br />
<br />

	Redness of the skin, caused by hyperemia of the capillaries in the lower layers of the skin.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100725" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Lichenification</a></h3>
	Thickening and hardening of the epidermis seen with exaggeration of normal skin lines.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007530" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Punctate palmoplantar hyperkeratosis</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100825" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cheilitis</a></h3>
	Inflammation of the lip.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
It is associated with many conditions, including megaloblastic anemia from vitamin B12 deficiency, iron deficiency anemia (which in severe cases can lead to Plummer-Vinson syndrome) and oral candidiasis. It can also be a symptom of allergies, such as allergy to Balsam of Peru. Cheilitis can also be caused by taking the (retinoid) drug Isotretinoin. It may also be a pre-malignant lesion for squamous cell carcinoma.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000982" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Palmoplantar keratoderma</a></h3>
	Abnormal thickening of the skin of the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008064" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ichthyosis</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the skin characterized the presence of excessive amounts of dry surface scales on the skin resulting from an abnormality of keratinization.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The ichthyoses are a group of skin diseases characterized by drying and scaling of skin with the accumulation of thick scales and cracks that may be painful or bleed. The abnormality in ichthyosis lies in am imbalance in the normal lifecycle of skin in which growth is matched with dying and shedding of skin cells. In ichthyosis, skin cells reproduce at a rate faster than dead skin cells can be shed or reproduce at a normal rate with a reduction in the rate of shedding. Either abnormality leads to a build up of dry and scaly skin. Note that this term refers to the morphological abnormality of the skin and not the disorder.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000962" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperkeratosis</a></h3>
	Hyperkeratosis is thickening of the outer layer of the skin, the stratum corneum, which is composed of large, polyhedral, plate-like envelopes filled with keratin which are the dead cells that have migrated up from the stratum granulosum.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0200041" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Skin erosion</a></h3>
	A discontinuity of the skin exhibiting incomplete loss of the epidermis, a lesion that is moist, circumscribed, and usually depressed.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000966" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypohidrosis</a></h3>
	Abnormally diminished capacity to sweat.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001805" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Thick nail</a></h3>
	Nail that appears thick when viewed on end.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
There is a build up of keratin causing the nail plate to lift away from the nail bed. The thickened nail plate is usually very hard. Onychauxis and onychogryposis are dystrophic diseases of the nail in which the nail plate becomes decidedly hypertrophied. The differentiation of the two entities is only one of degree of severity.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001025" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Urticaria</a></h3>
	Raised, well-circumscribed areas of erythema and edema involving the dermis and epidermis. Urticaria is intensely pruritic, and blanches completely with pressure.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001508" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Failure to thrive</a></h3>
	Failure to thrive (FTT) refers to a child whose physical growth is substantially below the norm.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Although there is no clear consensus on the exact definition of FTT, it is usually diagnoses in a child growing below the 3rd percentile or in a child whose decreased growth has cross two major growth percentiles (for example, from above the 75th percentile to below the 25th percentile).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001880" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Eosinophilia</a></h3>
	Increased count of eosinophils in the blood.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005406" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent bacterial skin infections</a></h3>
	Increased susceptibility to bacterial infections of the skin, as manifested by recurrent episodes of infectious dermatitis.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Infectious dermatitis may manifest as impetigo, multiple purulent blisters, erythema, lymphadenopathy near the site of infection.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001019" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Erythroderma</a></h3>
	An inflammatory exfoliative dermatosis involving nearly all of the surface of the skin. Erythroderma develops suddenly. A patchy erythema may generalize and spread to affect most of the skin. Scaling may appear in 2-6 days and be accompanied by hot, red, dry skin, malaise, and fever.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100665" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Angioedema</a></h3>
	Rapid swelling (edema) of the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, mucosa and submucosal tissues of the skin of the face, normally around the mouth, and the mucosa of the mouth and/or throat, as well as the tongue during a period of minutes to several hours. The swelling can also occur elsewhere, typically in the hands. Angioedema is similar to urticaria, but the swelling is subcutaneous rather than on the epidermis.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Apart from the common form, mediated by allergy, it has been reported as a side effect of some medications, in particular ACE inhibitors. Additionally, there are three autosomal dominant inherited forms known, due to mutations in the genes that control the clotting cascade, including the SERPING1 gene, which results in deficiency of the blood protein C1-inhibitor (type I HAE) and the F12 gene, which controls Factor XII (type III HAE). There is an additional type in which C1 levels are normal but C1 function is decreased (type II HAE). All three forms are called hereditary angioedema (HAE) or occasionally by the outdated term 'hereditary angioneurotic edema' (HANE). In all forms of HAE, swelling may also occur in the digestive tract and other organs. It is life-threatening when it involves the larynx due to the potential for asphyxiation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012393" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Allergy</a></h3>
	An allergy is an immune response or reaction to substances that are usually not harmful.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001006" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypotrichosis</a></h3>
	Congenital lack of hair growth.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Unlike alopecia, which describes hair loss where formerly there was hair growth, hypotrichosis describes a situation where there wasn't any hair growth in the first place.
