Severe ventriculomegaly: intracranial haemorrhage of any underlying cause; twin pregnancy related problems. 
Microcephaly: Parental head circumference measuring &lt;3rd percentile, normal HC/AC and HC/FL ratios.
For all: A known genetic or chromosomal cause.</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:

•	chromosome microarray
•	ASPM and other genes dictated by the phenotype</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

Comment:
By prenatal ultrasound, cerebellar hypoplasia is diagnosed if the cerebellum measures more than two standard deviations below the mean. In adults, cerebellar hypoplasia is typically diagnosed by computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebellar hypoplasia can be diagnosed if there is a small cerebellum with fissures of normal size compared with the folia (this is a distinguishing characteristic compared with cerebellar atrophy).</p>

The anterior/posterior diameter is taken between the inferior/posterior surface of the vemis of the cerebellum to the inner surface of the cranium. An enlarged cisternal magna is defined by an anterior/posterior diameter of 10 mm or more (pmid:16100637).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001305" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dandy-Walker malformation</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A congenital brain malformation typically characterized by incomplete formation of the cerebellar vermis, dilation of the fourth ventricle, and enlargement of the posterior fossa. In layman&#39;s terms, Dandy Walker malformation is a cyst in the cerebellum (typically symmetrical) that is involved with the fourth ventricle. This may interfere with the ability to drain cerebrospinal fluid from the brain, resulting in hydrocephalus. Dandy Walker cysts are formed during early embryonic development, while the brain forms. The cyst in the cerebellum typically has several blood vessels running through it connecting to the brain, thereby prohibiting surgical removal.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormal appearance of the midbrain in axial magnetic resonance imaging in which the elongated superior cerebellar peduncles give the midbrain an appearance reminiscent of a molar or wisdom tooth.

Comment:
Molar tooth appearance results from a lack of normal decussation of superior cerebellar peduncular fiber tracts which in turn leads to enlargement of the peduncles, which also follow a more horizontal course. The absence of crossing fibers also leads to a reduction in the anteroposterior diameter of the midbrain and deepening of the interpeduncular cistern.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000256" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Macrocephaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Occipitofrontal (head) circumference greater than 97th centile compared to appropriate, age matched, sex-matched normal standards. Alternatively, a apparently increased size of the cranium.

Comment:
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far above the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Macrocephaly is an absolute term. The term relative macrocephaly can be used when the head size centile exceeds the centile for height, for example, head size at the 75th centile with height at the 5th centile for age and sex.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The presence of an abnormally large hypoechoic space in the posterior fetal neck (usually detected on prenatal ultrasound examination).

Comment:
Increased nuchal translucency may be related to a cystic hygroma or to mesenchymal edema. Increased nuchal translucency can be classified into three categories: 1) cardiac abnormalities, combined with abnormal ductus venosus flow velocities, is found, leading to the theory that cardiac failure causes nuchal translucency enlargement; 2) various types of abnormalities are found in the extracellular matrix of the nuchal skin of fetuses with increased nuchal translucency; 3) abnormal lymphatic development is demonstrated in fetuses with increased nuchal translucency.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The presence during the prenatal period of a cystic mass with multiple septa with multiple, asymmetric, thin-walled cysts near the posterior aspect of the neck. Fetal cystic hygroma can be defined as nuchal translucency with or without septations measuring greater than 3.0 mm.

Comment:
Upon ultrasound examination, fetal cystic hygroma presents as a cystic mass with multiple septa with multiple, asymmetric, thin-walled cysts related to the posterior aspect of the neck. Cystic hygromas can range from increased nuchal translucency to thin-walled cystic masses that may become larger than the fetal head. The cysts may result from a lymphatic abnormality, possibly one caused by absent or inefficient connections between the lymphatic and venous systems. Depending on the site, the cut off may vary from site to site. Lowest would be 2.5 mm and highest 3.5 mm.</p>
