- Clinical or molecular diagnosis of autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease<br />
- Known causative genetic or chromosomal abnormality

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
 - HNF1B if personal or family history of diabetes mellitus<br />
  - SALL1 if 2 out of imperforate anus, ear abnormalities, thumb abnormalities

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
 - HNF1B if personal or family history of diabetes mellitus<br />
  - SALL1 if 2 out of imperforate anus, ear abnormalities, thumb abnormalities

	A congenital anomaly of the urinary tract, in which the kidney is duplicated and is drained via two separate renal pelves and ureters.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000086" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ectopic kidney</a></h3>
	A developmental defect in which a kidney is located in an abnormal anatomic position.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000085" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Horseshoe kidney</a></h3>
	A connection of the right and left kidney by an isthmus of functioning renal parenchyma or fibrous tissue that crosses the midline.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000800" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cystic renal dysplasia</a></h3>

	Severe distention of the kidney with dilation of the renal pelvis and calices.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hydronephrosis can be caused by reflux or by retrograde pressure on the kidney when the flow of urine is obstructed.

	Eversion of the posterior bladder wall through the congenitally absent lower anterior abdominal wall and anterior bladder wall <br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Exstrophy of the bladder can be associated with Epispadias and Bifid penis or in females with Bifid clitoris, a bifid uterus, and a Septated vagina, each of which should be coded separately.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010957" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Congenital posterior urethral valve</a></h3>
	A developmental defect resulting in an obstructing membrane in the posterior male urethra.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Congenital posterior urethral valve is a cause of bladder outlet obstruction in male newborns. It results from a failure of resorption of the caudal end of the Wolffian duct into the primitive cloaca at the site of the future verumontanum in the posterior urethra (Following normal resorption of the posterior urethral valve there remain the posterior urethral folds, also called plicae colliculi).

<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.

	An abnormal morphology (form) of the face or its components.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term now covers many of the historical inexact descriptions such as Bird-like facies that probably should be avoided in modern genetics. This portion of the Ontology should be revised.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000458" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anosmia</a></h3>
	An inability to perceive odors. This is a general term describing inability to smell arising in any part of the process of smelling from absorption of odorants into the nasal mucous overlying the olfactory epithelium, diffusion to the cilia, binding to olfactory receptor sites, generation of action potentials in olfactory neurons, and perception of a smell.

	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.

	Congenital developmental defect arising from the primitive branchial apparatus.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
During embryonic development the major head and neck structures are formed from the five pharyngeal arches (bands of tissue). Incomplete, failed or persistent embryonic development of these arches results in several anomalies or defects in the neck.
