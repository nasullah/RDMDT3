  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Unexplained multi-system progressive disorder usually involving the central nervous system and/or neuromuscular system
- Contributory laboratory findings may include but are not restricted to:
  - characteristic brain MR imaging, e.g. brainstem or basal ganglia involvement, infarction not confined to typical vascular territory, leukoencephalopathy
  - raised serum, CSF or urinary organic acid biomarkers (e.g. lactate, 3-MGA)
  - evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in diagnostic biopsies including histochemical (COX-deficient fibres, ragged-red fibres) and biochemical (respiratory chain enzyme deficiencies) markers of disease pathology.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Mitochondrial DNA and common nuclear genetic causes (e.g. POLG) excluded (m.3243A&gt;G, POLG)</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 - Mitochondrial DNA
  - Common nuclear genetic causes as appropriate</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

Comment:
The diagnosis of optic atrophy is made when the optic disc loses its normal orange-pink color. Optic atrophy is an end stage that arises from myriad causes of optic nerve damage anywhere along the path from the retina to the lateral geniculate. Some of the most common etiologies are advanced glaucoma, optic neuritis, arteritic or non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy or a compressive lesion.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormal appearance of muscle fibers observed on muscle biopsy. Ragged red fibers can be visualized with Gomori trichrome staining as irregular and intensely red subsarcolemmal zones, whereas the normal myofibrils are green. The margins of affect fibers appear red and ragged. The ragged-red  is due to the accumulation of abnormal mitochondria below the plasma membrane of the muscle fiber, leading to the appearance of a red rim and speckled sarcoplasm.

Comment:
MERGED COMMENT:
TARGET COMMENT: This finding is demonstrated by muscle biopsy. Note that additionally, muscle fibers with mitochondrial proliferation stain darkly for succinic dehydrogenase (SDH).

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001298" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Encephalopathy</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Encephalopathy is a term that means brain disease, damage, or malfunction. In general, encephalopathy is manifested by an altered mental state.

Comment:
This term and its children are general and bundled terms that are kept for convenience. For new annotations, it is recommended that the specific phenotypic abnormalities be noted.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.

Comment:
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001251" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ataxia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- oder overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly).

Comment:
Ataxia can be differentiated into dyssynergy, asynergy, dysmetria (hypometria, hypermetria), dysdiadochokinesis, gait ataxia, truncal ataxia, limb ataxia, and dysarthria). Note: This term does not include sensory ataxia.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001332" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dystonia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormally increased muscular tone that causes fixed abnormal postures. There is a slow, intermittent twisting motion that leads to exaggerated turning and posture of the extremities and trunk.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002071" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of extrapyramidal motor function</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A neurological condition related to lesions of the basal ganglia leading to typical abnormalities including akinesia (inability to initiate changes in activity and perform volitional movements rapidly and easily), muscular rigidity (continuous contraction of muscles with constant resistance to passive movement), chorea (widespread arrhythmic movements of a forcible, rapid, jerky, and restless nature), athetosis (inability to sustain the muscles of the fingers, toes, or other group of muscles in a fixed position), and akathisia (inability to remain motionless).

Comment:
The basal ganglia, paired subcortical masses of grey matter that form distinct nuclei, subserve motor functions that are distinct from those of the pyramidal (i.e., corticospinal) tract. This is a bundled term that is kept for historical reasons, but it is preferable to annotate the precise abnormalities observed.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002401" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Stroke-like episodes</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002134" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the basal ganglia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormality of the basal ganglia.

Comment:
The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei (striatum, pallidum substantia nigra, and the subthalamic nucleus) at the base of the forebrain that are connected to the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, and other areas. The basal ganglia subserve motor functions that are distinct from those of the pyramidal (corticospinal) tract, for which reason neurologic abnormalities caused by lesions to the basal ganglia are often referred to as extrapyramidal.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002415" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Leukodystrophy</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Leukodystrophy refers to deterioration of white matter of the brain resulting from degeneration of myelin sheaths in the CNS. Their basic defect is directly related to the synthesis and maintenance of myelin membranes.

Comment:
The deterioration coincides with clinical regression of skills, and in the most severe cases neurological devastation. Leukodystrophy should be distinguished from leukoencephalopathy (defect causing secondary myelin damage). Note that the term leukodystrophy is most often used to refer to a disease rather than a phenotypic feature, and a more precise description is to be preferred if possible.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012502" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the internal capsule</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An anomaly of the internal capsule, which is an area of white matter in the brain that separates the caudate nucleus and the thalamus from the putamen and the globus pallidus.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001272" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebellar atrophy</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Atrophy (wasting) of the cerebellum.

Comment:
Cerebellar atrophy can be diagnosed if the cerebellum is small with shrunken folia and large cerebellar fissures or if it has been shown to undergo progressive volume loss.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007360" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the cerebellum</a></h3>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001924" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sideroblastic anemia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Sideroblastic anemia results from a defect in the incorporation of iron into the heme molecule. A sideroblast is an erythroblast that has stainable deposits of iron in cytoplasm (this can be demonstrated by Prussian blue staining).

Comment:
Sideroblastic anemia may be either congenital or acquired. In sideroblastic anemia, the hematocrit tends to be around 20 to 30 percent, and the mean corpuscular volume is normal or low.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001012" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Multiple lipomas</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The presence of multiple lipomas (a type of benign tissue made of fatty tissue).

Comment:
A lipoma is a benign tumor composed of fatty tissue. They are the most common form of soft tissue tumor and are usually soft to the touch, movable, and generally painless (but there is a separate entity of painful multiple lipomas which is a hereditary disease called Dercum disease or adiposis dolorosa). Many lipomas are small (under one centimeter diameter) but can enlarge to sizes greater than six centimeters. Lipomas are commonly found in adults from 40 to 60 years of age, but can also be found in children.</p>
