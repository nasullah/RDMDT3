  <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>

  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Generalised peeling skin with or without atopy, OR
•	Acral peeling skin (TGM5 mutations excluded), OR
•	Peeling skin in association with other features, OR
AND
•	Diagnosis of peeling skin syndrome confirmed by consultant dermatogist</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Peeling skin cases that have not had the genetic testing below</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 -	For those with acral peeling skin: TGM5</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008064" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ichthyosis</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of the skin characterized the presence of excessive amounts of dry surface scales on the skin resulting from an abnormality of keratinization.

Comment:
The ichthyoses are a group of skin diseases characterized by drying and scaling of skin with the accumulation of thick scales and cracks that may be painful or bleed. The abnormality in ichthyosis lies in am imbalance in the normal lifecycle of skin in which growth is matched with dying and shedding of skin cells. In ichthyosis, skin cells reproduce at a rate faster than dead skin cells can be shed or reproduce at a normal rate with a reduction in the rate of shedding. Either abnormality leads to a build up of dry and scaly skin. Note that this term refers to the morphological abnormality of the skin and not the disorder.</p>

Comment:
It is associated with many conditions, including megaloblastic anemia from vitamin B12 deficiency, iron deficiency anemia (which in severe cases can lead to Plummer-Vinson syndrome) and oral candidiasis. It can also be a symptom of allergies, such as allergy to Balsam of Peru. Cheilitis can also be caused by taking the (retinoid) drug Isotretinoin. It may also be a pre-malignant lesion for squamous cell carcinoma.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001805" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Thick nail</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Nail that appears thick when viewed on end.

Comment:
There is a build up of keratin causing the nail plate to lift away from the nail bed. The thickened nail plate is usually very hard. Onychauxis and onychogryposis are dystrophic diseases of the nail in which the nail plate becomes decidedly hypertrophied. The differentiation of the two entities is only one of degree of severity.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Failure to thrive (FTT) refers to a child whose physical growth is substantially below the norm.

Comment:
Although there is no clear consensus on the exact definition of FTT, it is usually diagnoses in a child growing below the 3rd percentile or in a child whose decreased growth has cross two major growth percentiles (for example, from above the 75th percentile to below the 25th percentile).</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001019" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Erythroderma</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An inflammatory exfoliative dermatosis involving nearly all of the surface of the skin. Erythroderma develops suddenly. A patchy erythema may generalize and spread to affect most of the skin. Scaling may appear in 2-6 days and be accompanied by hot, red, dry skin, malaise, and fever.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100665" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Angioedema</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Rapid swelling (edema) of the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, mucosa and submucosal tissues of the skin of the face, normally around the mouth, and the mucosa of the mouth and/or throat, as well as the tongue during a period of minutes to several hours. The swelling can also occur elsewhere, typically in the hands. Angioedema is similar to urticaria, but the swelling is subcutaneous rather than on the epidermis.

Comment:
Apart from the common form, mediated by allergy, it has been reported as a side effect of some medications, in particular ACE inhibitors. Additionally, there are three autosomal dominant inherited forms known, due to mutations in the genes that control the clotting cascade, including the SERPING1 gene, which results in deficiency of the blood protein C1-inhibitor (type I HAE) and the F12 gene, which controls Factor XII (type III HAE). There is an additional type in which C1 levels are normal but C1 function is decreased (type II HAE). All three forms are called hereditary angioedema (HAE) or occasionally by the outdated term &#39;hereditary angioneurotic edema&#39; (HANE). In all forms of HAE, swelling may also occur in the digestive tract and other organs. It is life-threatening when it involves the larynx due to the potential for asphyxiation.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012393" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Allergy</a></h3>

Comment:
Unlike alopecia, which describes hair loss where formerly there was hair growth, hypotrichosis describes a situation where there wasn&#39;t any hair growth in the first place.</p>
