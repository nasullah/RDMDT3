						<!-- <h2>Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome eligibility</h2> -->
Relevant diseases: <br />
•	Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome <br />
•	Sotos syndrome <br />
•	Weaver syndrome

<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
Clinical diagnosis of non-BWS overgrowth disorders (e.g. Sotos, Weaver, Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndromes) without detectable germline mutation in relevant genes (e.g. EZH2, NSD1, GPC3).

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>


<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
 

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	The presence of excess amniotic fluid in the uterus during pregnancy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Polyhydramnios is diagnosed if the deepest vertical pool of amniotic fluid is more than 8 cm or amniotic fluid index is more than 95th percentile for the corresponding gestational age.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006267" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Large placenta</a></h3>
	Increased size of the placenta.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001998" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neonatal hypoglycemia</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008872" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Feeding difficulties in infancy</a></h3>
	Impaired feeding performance of an infant as manifested by difficulties such as weak and ineffective sucking, brief bursts of sucking, and falling asleep during sucking. There may be difficulties with chewing or maintaining attention.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002104" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Apnea</a></h3>
	Lack of breathing with no movement of the respiratory muscles and no exchange of air in the lungs. This term refers to a disposition to have recurrent episodes of apnea rather than to a single event.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005949" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Apneic episodes in infancy</a></h3>
	Recurrent episodes of apnea occurring during infancy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000961" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cyanosis</a></h3>
	A bluish or purplish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to an increase in the amount of deoxygenated hemoglobin in the blood or a structural defect in the hemoglobin molecule.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005616" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Accelerated skeletal maturation</a></h3>
	An abnormally increased rate of skeletal maturation. Accelerated skeletal maturation can be diagnosed on the basis of an estimation of the bone age from radiographs of specific bones in the human body.

	An abnormal difference between the left and right sides of the face.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100554" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hemihypertrophy of upper limb</a></h3>
	Overgrowth of only one arm.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001555" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Asymmetry of the thorax</a></h3>
	Lack of symmetry between the left and right halves of the thorax.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100553" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hemihypertrophy of lower limb</a></h3>
	Overgrowth of only one leg.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001052" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nevus flammeus</a></h3>
	A congenital vascular malformation consisting of superficial and deep dilated capillaries in the skin which produce a reddish to purplish discolouration of the skin.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000158" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Macroglossia</a></h3>
	Increased length and width of the tongue.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Normal standards do not exist. Large size usually leads to protrusion of the tongue. This is an acknowledged bundled term, but due to its frequent usage and relative paucity of situations that would call for separate individual assessments of tongue dimensions, the bundled term is retained. Micrognathia may give the false appearance of a large tongue.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000303" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Mandibular prognathia</a></h3>
	Abnormal prominence of the chin related to increased length of the mandible.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000269" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Prominent occiput</a></h3>
	Increased convexity of the occiput (posterior part of the skull).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Increased convexity of the occiput gives an appearance of prominence. There are no objective measures for convexity of the occiput, and evaluation depends heavily on the experience of the observer. This finding may or may not be accompanied by Dolichocephaly, but this should be coded separately.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009117" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the maxilla</a></h3>
	Absence or underdevelopment of the Maxilla.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009908" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anterior creases of earlobe</a></h3>
	Sharply demarcated, typically linear and approximately horizontal, indentations in the outer surface of the ear lobe.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Shallow grooves or indentations are quite common, especially in large lobes. Ear lobe creases may arise postnatally. Posterior helical pits can be a related finding but should be assessed and coded separately.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008523" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Posterior helix pit</a></h3>
	Permanent indentation on the posteromedial aspect of the helix that may be sharply or indistinctly delineated.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
They are usually linear to a narrow oval in shape and may be single or multiple.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000175" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft palate</a></h3>
	Cleft palate is a developmental defect of the palate resulting from a failure of fusion of the palatine processes and manifesting as a separation of the roof of the mouth (soft and hard palate).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Cleft palate is a developmental defect that occurs between the 7th and 12th week of pregnancy. Normally, the palatine processes fuse during this time to form the soft and hard palate. A failure of fusion results in a cleft palate. The clinical spectrum ranges from bifid uvula, to (incomplete or complete) cleft of the soft palate, up to (complete or incomplete) cleft of both the soft and hard palate.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001901" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Polycythemia</a></h3>
	Polycythemia is diagnosed if the red blood cell count, the hemoglobin level, and the red blood cell volume all exceed the upper limits of normal.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001629" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ventricular septal defect</a></h3>
	A hole between the two bottom chambers (ventricles) of the heart. The defect is centered around the most superior aspect of the ventricular septum.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001631" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Defect in the atrial septum</a></h3>
	Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a congenital abnormality of the interatrial septum that enables blood flow between the left and right atria via the interatrial septum.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001636" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Tetralogy of Fallot</a></h3>
	A congenital cardiac malformation comprising pulmonary stenosis, overriding aorta, ventricular septum defect, and right ventricular hypertrophy. The diagnosis of TOF is made if at least three of the four above mentioned features are present.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001680" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Coarctation of aorta</a></h3>
	Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing or constriction of a segment of the aorta.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Coarctation refers to a narrowing of the lumen of a vessel producing an obstruction to flow. Coarctation can occur in any region of the aorta.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001638" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cardiomyopathy</a></h3>
	A myocardial disorder in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal, in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease and congenital heart disease sufficient to cause the observed myocardial abnormality.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010866" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abdominal wall defect</a></h3>
	An incomplete closure of the abdominal wall.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001539" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Omphalocele</a></h3>
	A midline anterior incomplete closure of the abdominal wall in which there is herniation of the abdominal viscera into the base of the abdominal cord.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001537" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Umbilical hernia</a></h3>
	Protrusion of abdominal contents through a defect in the abdominal wall musculature around the umbilicus. Skin and subcutaneous tissue overlie the defect.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004794" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Malrotation of small bowel</a></h3>
	A deviation from the normal rotation of the midgut during embryologic development with mislocalization of the small bowel.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Malrotation results not only in the malposition of the bowel but also in the malfixation of the mesentery. The normally broad mesenteric attachment is shortened to a narrow pedicle that predisposes the patient to the complication of midgut volvulus.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000105" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Enlarged kidneys</a></h3>
	An abnormal increase in the size of the kidney.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The main causes of large kidney are hydronephrosis, polycystic disease, renal cell carcinoma, nephroblastoma/Wilm's tumor (in children), and solitary cysts. If possible, a specific term should be used instead of this one.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001744" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Splenomegaly</a></h3>
	Abnormal increased size of the spleen.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002240" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hepatomegaly</a></h3>
	Abnormally increased size of the liver.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000047" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypospadias</a></h3>
	Displacement of the urethral opening on the ventral (inferior) surface of the penis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000028" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cryptorchidism</a></h3>
	Testis in inguinal canal. That is, absence of one or both testes from the scrotum owing to failure of the testis or testes to descend through the inguinal canal to the testis.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The gonad is mobile and can be retracted superiorly by the cremaster muscle reflex stimulated, for instance, by cold or touch. A retracted testis is not cryptorchidism. An abdominal testis cannot be distinguished by physical examination from an (Apparently) absent testis and requires radiological (or, rarely, surgical) procedures for assessment.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000023" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Inguinal hernia</a></h3>
	Protrusion of the contents of the abdominal cavity through the inguinal canal.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Inguinal hernia appears as a bulge in the groin.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
	A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002194" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Delayed gross motor development</a></h3>
	A type of motor delay characterized by an delay in acquiring the ability to control the large muscles of the body for walking, running, sitting, and crawling.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010862" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Delayed fine motor development</a></h3>
	A type of motor delay characterized by an delay in acquiring the ability to control the fingers and hands.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000750" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Delayed speech and language development</a></h3>
	A degree of language development that is significantly below the norm for a child of a specified age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Language delay can be characterized by a failure to meet the developmental milestones for language development, an inability to follow directions, or slow or incomprehensible speech after the age of three years, as well as with severe problems with syntax or articulation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001328" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Specific learning disability</a></h3>
	Impairment of certain skills such as reading or writing, coordination, self-control, or attention that interfere with the ability to learn. The impairment is not related to a global deficiency of intelligence.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term learning disability is used with different meanings in different contexts. Significant impairments of mental functioning with a reduction in IQ below 70 should be coded as mental retardation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000729" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Autistic behavior</a></h3>
	A disorder beginning in childhood. It is marked by the presence of markedly abnormal or impaired development in social interaction and communication and a markedly restricted repertoire of activity and interest. Manifestations of the disorder vary greatly depending on the developmental level and chronological age of the individual (DSM-IV).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term can be used to refer to autism spectrum disorder as a phenotypic feature that can be a component of a disease. Autism spectrum disorder range from a severe form, called autistic disorder, to a milder form, Asperger syndrome.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007018" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a></h3>
	Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) manifests at age 2-3 years or by first grade at the latest. The main symptoms are distractibility, impulsivity, hyperactivity, and often trouble organizing tasks and projects, difficulty going to sleep, and social problems from being aggressive, loud, or impatient.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012433" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal social behavior</a></h3>
	An abnormality of  actions or reactions of a person taking place during interactions with others.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100851" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal emotion/affect behavior</a></h3>
	An abnormality of emotional behaviour.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000505" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Visual impairment</a></h3>
	Visual impairment (or vision impairment) is vision loss (of a person) to such a degree as to qualify as an additional support need through a significant limitation of visual capability resulting from either disease, trauma, or congenital or degenerative conditions that cannot be corrected by conventional means, such as refractive correction, medication, or surgery.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002667" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nephroblastoma (Wilms tumor)</a></h3>
	The presence of a nephroblastoma, which is a neoplasm of the kidney that primarily affects children.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Nephroblastoma is characterized by an abnormal proliferation of the metanephric blastema cells, which are believed to be primitive embryologic cells of the kidney. Clinically, nephroblatoma usually presents as an abdominal mass, and in some cases with abdominal pain, hypertension, hematuria, and fever.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003006" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neuroblastoma</a></h3>
	Neuroblastoma is a solid tumor that originate in neural crest cells of the sympathetic nervous system. Most neuroblastomas originate in the abdomen, and most abdominal neuroblastomas originate in the adrenal gland. Neuroblastomas can also originate in the thorax, usually in the posterior mediastinum.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002884" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hepatoblastoma</a></h3>
	A kind of neoplasm of the liver that originates from immature liver precursor cells and macroscopically is composed of tissue resembling fetal or mature liver cells or bile ducts.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hepatoblastoma occurs nearly exclusively in infants and children.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100641" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neoplasm of the adrenal cortex</a></h3>
	The presence of a neoplasm of the adrenal cortex.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002859" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Rhabdomyosarcoma</a></h3>
