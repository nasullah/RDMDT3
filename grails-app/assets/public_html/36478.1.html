	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002194" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Delayed gross motor development</a></h3>
	A type of motor delay characterized by an delay in acquiring the ability to control the large muscles of the body for walking, running, sitting, and crawling.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010862" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Delayed fine motor development</a></h3>
	A type of motor delay characterized by an delay in acquiring the ability to control the fingers and hands.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000750" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Delayed speech and language development</a></h3>
	A degree of language development that is significantly below the norm for a child of a specified age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Language delay can be characterized by a failure to meet the developmental milestones for language development, an inability to follow directions, or slow or incomprehensible speech after the age of three years, as well as with severe problems with syntax or articulation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001290" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Generalized hypotonia</a></h3>
	Generalized muscular hypotonia (abnormally low muscle tone).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002419" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Molar tooth sign on MRI</a></h3>
	An abnormal appearance of the midbrain in axial magnetic resonance imaging in which the elongated superior cerebellar peduncles give the midbrain an appearance reminiscent of a molar or wisdom tooth.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Molar tooth appearance results from a lack of normal decussation of superior cerebellar peduncular fiber tracts which in turn leads to enlargement of the peduncles, which also follow a more horizontal course. The absence of crossing fibers also leads to a reduction in the anteroposterior diameter of the midbrain and deepening of the interpeduncular cistern.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001320" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebellar vermis hypoplasia</a></h3>
	Underdevelopment of the vermis of cerebellum.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002085" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Occipital encephalocele</a></h3>
	A type of encephalocele (that is, a a protrusion of part of the cranial contents including brain tissue through a congenital opening in the cranium, typically covered with skin or mucous membrane) in the occipital region of the skull. Occipital encephalocele presents as a midline swelling over the occipital bone.   It is usually covered with normal full-thickness scalp.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002126" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Polymicrogyria</a></h3>
	A congenital abnormality of the cerebral hemisphere characterized by an excessive number of small gyri (convolutions) on the surface of the brain.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Polymicrogyria, one of the most common malformations of cortical development, is characterized histologically by the appearance of an excessive number of small cortical folds, often fused together, with disordered cortical lamination.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002790" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neonatal breathing dysregulation</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000657" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Oculomotor apraxia</a></h3>
	Inability to follow objects visually with compensatory head movements, decreased smooth pursuit, and cancellation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Oculomotor apraxia leads defective or absent horizontal voluntary eye movements with head thrusting to look at objects to the side as well as jerky, abnormal eye movements.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000556" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Retinal dystrophy</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001999" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal facial shape</a></h3>
	An abnormal morphology (form) of the face or its components.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term now covers many of the historical inexact descriptions such as Bird-like facies that probably should be avoided in modern genetics. This portion of the Ontology should be revised.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000191" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Accessory oral frenulum</a></h3>
	Extra fold of tissue extending from the alveolar ridge to the inner surface of the upper or lower lip.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding is assessed by gently retracting the oral mucosa from the alveolar ridge. Typically there is a single maxillary and a single mandibular frenulum located in the midline between the two central incisors. Abnormalities of the alveolar ridges may accompany accessory frenula, but these should be assessed separately.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011802" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hamartoma of tongue</a></h3>
	A benign (noncancerous) tumorlike malformation made up of an abnormal mixture of cells and tissues that originates in the tongue.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002564" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Malformation of the heart and great vessels</a></h3>
	Congenital malformation of the heart or great vessels (i.e., the large blood vesslesentering and leaving the heart: aorta, the pulmonary arteries and veins, and the superior and inferior vena cava).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This category is meant to comprise congenital (developmental) structural heart defects.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004719" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperechogenic kidneys</a></h3>
	An increase in amplitude of waves returned in ultrasonography of the kidney, which is generally displayed as increased brightness of the signal.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005562" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Multiple renal cysts</a></h3>
	The presence of many cysts in the kidney.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012622" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Chronic kidney disease</a></h3>
	Functional anomaly of the kidney persisting for at least three months.

	The presence of fibrosis of the liver tissue.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002910" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Elevated hepatic transaminases</a></h3>
	Elevations of the levels of SGOT and SGPT in the serum. SGOT (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase) and SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase) are transaminases primarily found in the liver and heart and are released into the bloodstream as the result of liver or heart damage. SGOT and SGPT are used clinically mainly as markers of liver damage.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001177" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Preaxial hand polydactyly</a></h3>
	Supernumerary digits located at the radial side of the hand. Polydactyly (supernumerary digits) involving the thumb occurs in many distinct forms of high variability and severity. Ranging from fleshy nubbins over varying degrees of partial duplication/splitting to completely duplicated or even triplicated thumbs or preaxial (on the radial side of the hand) supernumerary digits.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001162" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Postaxial hand polydactyly</a></h3>
	Supernumerary digits located at the ulnar side of the hand (that is, on the side with the fifth finger).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006159" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Mesoaxial hand polydactyly</a></h3>
	The presence of a supernumerary finger (not a thumb) involving the third or fourth metacarpal with associated osseous syndactyly.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001513" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Obesity</a></h3>
	Body weight that is grossly above the acceptable or desirable weight, usually due to accumulation of excess fats in the body. The standards may vary with age, sex, genetic or cultural background. In the body mass index (BMI), a BMI greater than 30.0 kg/m2 is considered obese, and a BMI greater than 40.0 kg/m2 is considered morbidly obese.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
	A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
	Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000256" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Macrocephaly</a></h3>
	Occipitofrontal (head) circumference greater than 97th centile compared to appropriate, age matched, sex-matched normal standards. Alternatively, a apparently increased size of the cranium.<br />
<br />

The term relative macrocephaly can be used when the head size centile exceeds the centile for height, for example, head size at the 75th centile with height at the 5th centile for age and sex.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001251" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ataxia</a></h3>
	Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- oder overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Ataxia can be differentiated into dyssynergy, asynergy, dysmetria (hypometria, hypermetria), dysdiadochokinesis, gait ataxia, truncal ataxia, limb ataxia, and dysarthria). Note: This term does not include sensory ataxia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000589" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Coloboma</a></h3>
	A developmental defect characterized by a cleft of some portion of the eye or ocular adnexa.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000175" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft palate</a></h3>
	Cleft palate is a developmental defect of the palate resulting from a failure of fusion of the palatine processes and manifesting as a separation of the roof of the mouth (soft and hard palate).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Cleft palate is a developmental defect that occurs between the 7th and 12th week of pregnancy. Normally, the palatine processes fuse during this time to form the soft and hard palate. A failure of fusion results in a cleft palate. The clinical spectrum ranges from bifid uvula, to (incomplete or complete) cleft of the soft palate, up to (complete or incomplete) cleft of both the soft and hard palate.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000822" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypertension</a></h3>
	The presence of chronic increased pressure in the systemic arterial system.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic BP (140 mm Hg or higher), diastolic BP (90 mm Hg or higher), or both.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004322" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short stature</a></h3>
	A height below that which is expected according to age and gender norms. Although there is no universally accepted definition of short stature, many refer to "short stature" as height more than 2 standard deviations below the mean for age and gender (or below the 3rd percentile for age and gender dependent norms).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010112" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Mesoaxial foot polydactyly</a></h3>
	The presence of a supernumerary toe (not a hallux) involving the third or fourth metatarsal with associated osseous syndactyly.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001841" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Preaxial foot polydactyly</a></h3>
	Duplication of all or part of the first ray.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term applies for a wide variety of partial and/or complete duplications of the phalanges of the big toe (sometimes including the 1st metatarsal). A partial duplication can present itself on x-rays as a notched phalanx, bifid phalanx or a broadened phalanx. Polydactyly affecting the big toe is called preaxial or hallucal polydactyly of the feet.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001830" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Postaxial foot polydactyly</a></h3>
	Polydactyly of the foot most commonly refers to the presence of six toes on one foot. Postaxial polydactyly affects the lateral ray and the duplication may range from a well-formed articulated digit to a rudimentary digit.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The modifier postaxial means that the supernumerary digit is not a hallux.
