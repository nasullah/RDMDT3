  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Patients with a proven or suspected inherited white mater disorder on the basis of abnormal white matter on MR imaging reviewed by an expert neuroradiologist.
•	Relevant metabolic investigations completed, for example very long chain fatty acids, white cell enzymes and urine organic acids where indicated</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Known genetic cause
•	Evidence of causative environmental cause, for example infection, hypoxia or inflammation
•	Phenotype indicative of other recruitable rare disorder, for example Cockayne syndrome or intracerebral calcification indicative of Aicardi-Goutiere’s syndrome, or a peroxisomal disorder, in which case recruit to relevant category</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 -	Guided by phenotype, for example PLP1 in males with a phenotype suggestive of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease or GJA1 in the presence of phenotypic features of oculodentodigital dysplasia.</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Insufficient production of steroid hormones (primarily cortisol) by the adrenal glands as a result of a primary defect in the glands themselves.

Comment:
Adrenal insufficiency may cause persistent vomiting, anorexia, hypoglycemia, poor weight gain in a child, or unexplained weight loss in an adult, malaise, fatigue, muscular weakness, unexplained isotonic or hyponatremic dehydration, hyperkalemia, hypotension, hypoglycemia and especially generalized hyperpigmentation.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000824" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Growth hormone deficiency</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Insufficient production of growth hormone, which is produced by the anterior pituitary gland. Growth hormone is a major participant in control of growth and metabolism.

Comment:
The effects of growth hormone are mediated almost exclusively by insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF-1), which is produced primarily in the liver. Growth hormone deficiency refers to inadequate levels of GH (and therefore IGF-1), resulting in growth retardation in children and metabolic disturbances in adults.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Failure to thrive (FTT) refers to a child whose physical growth is substantially below the norm.

Comment:
Although there is no clear consensus on the exact definition of FTT, it is usually diagnoses in a child growing below the 3rd percentile or in a child whose decreased growth has cross two major growth percentiles (for example, from above the 75th percentile to below the 25th percentile).</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormal morphology (form) of the face or its components.

Comment:
This term now covers many of the historical inexact descriptions such as Bird-like facies that probably should be avoided in modern genetics. This portion of the Ontology should be revised.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010729" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cherry red spot of the macula</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Pallor of the perifoveal macula of the retina with appearance of a small circular reddish choroid shape as seen through the fovea centralis due to relative transparancy of the macula.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000501" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Glaucoma</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Glaucoma refers loss of retinal ganglion cells in a characteristic pattern of optic neuropathy usually associated with increased intraocular pressure.

Comment:
The feature that differentiates glaucoma from other causes of visual morbidity is a characteristic pattern of damage to the optic nerve head. This is most easily recognised at the superior and inferior poles of the optic disc. The vertical cup:disc ratio (VCDR) has proved to be a simple, relatively robust index of glaucomatous loss of the neuroretinal rim. As with intraocular pressure, VCDR is a continuous variable within the population.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000648" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Optic atrophy</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Atrophy of the optic nerve. Optic atrophy results from the death of the retinal ganglion cell axons that comprise the optic nerve and manifesting as a pale optic nerve on fundoscopy.

Comment:
The diagnosis of optic atrophy is made when the optic disc loses its normal orange-pink color. Optic atrophy is an end stage that arises from myriad causes of optic nerve damage anywhere along the path from the retina to the lateral geniculate. Some of the most common etiologies are advanced glaucoma, optic neuritis, arteritic or non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy or a compressive lesion.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000510" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Retinitis pigmentosa</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Hereditary degeneration and atrophy of the retina.

Comment:
Retinitis pigmentosa is a group of hereditary diseases of the eye. However, the term retinitis pigmentosa has also been used to describe the retinal findings characteristic of these diseases but also seen on other diseases such as Usher syndrome. It is preferable to describe the findings precisely if possible, but this term is kept for convenience.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000256" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Macrocephaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Occipitofrontal (head) circumference greater than 97th centile compared to appropriate, age matched, sex-matched normal standards. Alternatively, a apparently increased size of the cranium.

Comment:
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far above the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Macrocephaly is an absolute term. The term relative macrocephaly can be used when the head size centile exceeds the centile for height, for example, head size at the 75th centile with height at the 5th centile for age and sex.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.

Comment:
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000717" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Autism</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. Autism begins in childhood. It is marked by the presence of markedly abnormal or impaired development in social interaction and communication and a markedly restricted repertoire of activity and interest. Manifestations of the disorder vary greatly depending on the developmental level and chronological age of the individual (DSM-IV).

Comment:
The term refers to the diagnosis of autism and is left for convenience. However, it is preferable to annotate the exact phenotypic abnormalities rather than merely the diagnostic category autism.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000708" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Behavioral abnormality</a></h3>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An unintentional, oscillating to-and-fro muscle movement.

Comment:
Tremor is differentiated from other involuntary movement disorders, such as chorea, athetosis, ballism, tics, and myoclonus, by its repetitive, stereotyped movements of a regular amplitude and frequency. Clonus, unlike tremor, represents a rhythmic movement, which is increased by muscle stretching.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002072" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Chorea</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Chorea (Greek for &#39;dance&#39;) refers to widespread arrhythmic involuntary movements of a forcible, jerky and restless fashion.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001251" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ataxia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- oder overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly).

Comment:
Ataxia can be differentiated into dyssynergy, asynergy, dysmetria (hypometria, hypermetria), dysdiadochokinesis, gait ataxia, truncal ataxia, limb ataxia, and dysarthria). Note: This term does not include sensory ataxia.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.

Comment:
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormality of the basal ganglia.

Comment:
The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei (striatum, pallidum substantia nigra, and the subthalamic nucleus) at the base of the forebrain that are connected to the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, and other areas. The basal ganglia subserve motor functions that are distinct from those of the pyramidal (corticospinal) tract, for which reason neurologic abnormalities caused by lesions to the basal ganglia are often referred to as extrapyramidal.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of the skin characterized the presence of excessive amounts of dry surface scales on the skin resulting from an abnormality of keratinization.

Comment:
The ichthyoses are a group of skin diseases characterized by drying and scaling of skin with the accumulation of thick scales and cracks that may be painful or bleed. The abnormality in ichthyosis lies in am imbalance in the normal lifecycle of skin in which growth is matched with dying and shedding of skin cells. In ichthyosis, skin cells reproduce at a rate faster than dead skin cells can be shed or reproduce at a normal rate with a reduction in the rate of shedding. Either abnormality leads to a build up of dry and scaly skin. Note that this term refers to the morphological abnormality of the skin and not the disorder.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.

Comment:
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).</p>
