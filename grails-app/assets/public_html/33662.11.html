						<!-- <h2>Infantile nystagmus eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Nystagmus with onset in early infancy, AND<br />
•	Normal ophthalmological examination with normal VEP and ERG, AND<br />
•	Affected individual has a family history of infantile nystagmus or is the offspring of a consanguineous relationship

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Anterior segment disorders<br />
•	Retinal dystrophies<br />
•	Abnormal ERG and VEP<br />
•	Acquired nystagmus<br />
•	Grade 2 to 4 foveal hypoplasia<br />
•	Structural abnormality found on MRI brain scan

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
 FRMD7 unless inheritance through paternal line

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000639" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nystagmus</a></h3>
	Rhythmic, involuntary oscillations of one or both eyes related to abnormality in fixation, conjugate gaze, or vestibular mechanisms.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000505" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Visual impairment</a></h3>
	Visual impairment (or vision impairment) is vision loss (of a person) to such a degree as to qualify as an additional support need through a significant limitation of visual capability resulting from either disease, trauma, or congenital or degenerative conditions that cannot be corrected by conventional means, such as refractive correction, medication, or surgery.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000539" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of refraction</a></h3>
	An abnormality in the process of focusing of light by the eye in order to produce a sharp image on the retina.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000545" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Myopia</a></h3>
	An abnormality of refraction characterized by the ability to see objects nearby clearly, while objects in the distance appear blurry.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000540" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypermetropia</a></h3>
	An abnormality of refraction characterized by the ability to see objects in the distance clearly, while objects nearby appear blurry.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000483" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Astigmatism</a></h3>
	Astigmatism describes a refractive error  characterized by a difference in the horizontal and vertical  curvature of the cornea.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The irregular curvature associated with astigmatism means that the optical system is not symmetric about the optical axis. Most commonly the cornea is affected such that the refractive power in one meridian is less than that of the perpendicular axis. Astigmatism of significant degree causes blurry vision.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000646" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Amblyopia</a></h3>
	Reduced visual acuity that is uncorrectable by lenses in the absence of detectable anatomic defects in the eye or visual pathways.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Ambylopia can result from visual deprivation during the critical period of development of visual abilities which lasts to about the age of 8 years. Thus, ambylopia can result from strabismus, anisometropia, or high hypermetropia in there is a failure to form a focused image in one or both eyes.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000486" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Strabismus</a></h3>
	Strabismus (also known as squint) is a condition in which the eyes are not properly aligned with each other.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006934" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Congenital nystagmus</a></h3>
	Nystagmus dating from or present at birth.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012043" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pendular nystagmus</a></h3>
	Rhythmic, involuntary sinusoidal oscillations of one or both eyes. The waveform of pendular nystagmus may occur in any direction.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008026" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Horizontal opticokinetic nystagmus</a></h3>
