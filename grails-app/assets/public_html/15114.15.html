  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Progressive upper and/or lower motor neuron disease degeneration with clinical features of amyotrophy, spasticity, bulbar/pseudo-bulbar involvement  
- EMG/NCS consistent with MND 
- Positive family history of other affected family members with ALS or with FTD/ALS like phenotype or disease onset below 40 years.  

Individuals with severe or syndromic disease should be recruited according to standard guidance, typically as trios. Disease status of apparently unaffected participants should be determined according to standard clinical practice to detect cryptic disease.  In other cases, unaffected individuals should not be recruited. Recruitment in such families should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Identified underlying cause for clinical syndrome e.g. multi-focal motor neuropathy, lymphoma</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 - C9ORF72, SOD1</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Atrophy of the optic nerve. Optic atrophy results from the death of the retinal ganglion cell axons that comprise the optic nerve and manifesting as a pale optic nerve on fundoscopy.

Comment:
The diagnosis of optic atrophy is made when the optic disc loses its normal orange-pink color. Optic atrophy is an end stage that arises from myriad causes of optic nerve damage anywhere along the path from the retina to the lateral geniculate. Some of the most common etiologies are advanced glaucoma, optic neuritis, arteritic or non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy or a compressive lesion.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002380" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Fasciculations</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Fasciculations are observed as small, local, involuntary muscle contractions (twitching) visible under the skin. Fasciculations result from increased irritability of an axon (which in turn is often a manifestation of disease of a motor neuron). This leads to sporadic discharges of all the muscle fibers controlled by the axon in isolation from other motor units.

Comment:
This finding can be visible clinically and can be demonstrated by electromyography (EMG).</p>

Comment:
Distal lower limb muscle atrophy is commonly due to peripheral neuropathy.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001251" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ataxia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- oder overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly).

Comment:
Ataxia can be differentiated into dyssynergy, asynergy, dysmetria (hypometria, hypermetria), dysdiadochokinesis, gait ataxia, truncal ataxia, limb ataxia, and dysarthria). Note: This term does not include sensory ataxia.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002066" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Gait ataxia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A type of ataxia characterized by the impairment of the ability to coordinate the movements required for normal walking. Gait ataxia is characteirzed by a wide-based staggering gait with a tendency to fall.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002070" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Limb ataxia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A kind of ataxia that affects movements of the extremities.

Comment:
Limb ataxia is generally caused by lesions of the cerebellar hemispheres and associated pathways.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002134" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the basal ganglia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormality of the basal ganglia.

Comment:
The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei (striatum, pallidum substantia nigra, and the subthalamic nucleus) at the base of the forebrain that are connected to the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, and other areas. The basal ganglia subserve motor functions that are distinct from those of the pyramidal (corticospinal) tract, for which reason neurologic abnormalities caused by lesions to the basal ganglia are often referred to as extrapyramidal.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001332" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dystonia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormally increased muscular tone that causes fixed abnormal postures. There is a slow, intermittent twisting motion that leads to exaggerated turning and posture of the extremities and trunk.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001336" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Myoclonus</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Very brief, involuntary random muscular contractions occurring at rest, in response to sensory stimuli, or accompanying voluntary movements.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003474" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sensory impairment</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of the primary sensation that is mediated by peripheral nerves (pain, temperature, touch, vibration, joint position). The word hypoesthesia (or hyesthesia) refers to a reduction in cutaneous sensation to a specific type of testing.

Comment:
This term does not include abnormalities of cortical sensation such as two-point discrimination, stereognosis, and graphesthesia.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002495" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired vibratory sensation</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A decrease in the ability to perceive vibration. Clinically, this is usually tested with a tuning fork which vibrates at 128 Hz and is applied to bony prominences such as the malleoli at the ankles or the metacarpal-phalangeal joints. There is a slow decay of vibration from the tuning fork. The degree of vibratory sense loss can be crudely estimated by counting the number of seconds that the examiner can perceive the vibration longer than the patient.

Comment:
Impaired vibratory sensation may suggesti involvement of the posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway, which is responsible for transmitting fine touch, vibration and conscious proprioceptive information from the body to the cerebral cortex.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010830" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired tactile sensation</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A reduced sense of touch (tactile sensation). This is usually tested with a wisp of cotton or a fine camel&#39;s hair brush, by asking patients to say &#39;now&#39; each time they feel the stimulus.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010831" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired proprioception</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A loss or impairment of the sensation of the relative position of parts of the body and joint position.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010829" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired temperature sensation</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A reduced ability to discriminate between different temperatures.

Comment:
Temperature sensation can be tested by touching the skin several seconds with a water flask filled to the desired temperature. Persons with normal temperature sensation should at least be able to identify as warm a flask that is 35-36 degrees C and identify as cool a flask at 28-32 degrees C.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007328" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired pain sensation</a></h3>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012079" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of central motor conduction</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Any anomaly of the conduction of motor nerve impulses in the central nervous system.

Comment:
Nerve conduction velocity in the central motor pathways of the brain and spinal cord can be studied by methods including transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the cortex, cervical cord, thoracic cord and conus medullaris and determination of motor latencies to various muscles. This measure is thought to represent conduction in large diameter fibres in the corticospinal tracts.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007002" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Motor axonal neuropathy</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Progressive impairment of function of motor axons with muscle weakness, atrophy, and cramps. The deficits are length-dependent, meaning that muscles innervated by the longest nerves are affected first, so that for instance the arms are affected at a later age than the onset of deficits involving the lower leg.

Comment:
Distal motor neuropathy is a bundled term that should not be used if more detailed information about the phenotype is available.</p>
