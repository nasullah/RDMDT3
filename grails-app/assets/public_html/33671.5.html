						<!-- <h2>Familial pulmonary fibrosis eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Clinical syndrome consistent with interstitial lung disease: Breathlessness on exertion or cough, bilateral crepitations on examination, <br />
AND <br />
•	A High Resolution CT Scan with evidence of interstitial lung disease, AND <br />
•	A first degree relative with an interstitial lung disease

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
•	A respiratory disease other than an interstitial lung disease <br />
•	Any cystic lung disease

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
 SFTPB, SFTPC in childhood onset cases

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006530" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Interstitial pulmonary disease</a></h3>
	Abnormality of the lung parenchyma extending to the pulmonary interstitium and leading to diffuse pulmonary fibrosis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002206" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pulmonary fibrosis</a></h3>
	Replacement of normal lung tissues are progressively replaced by fibroblasts and collagen.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Pulmonary fibrosis leads to an irreversible impairment of alveolar oxygen transfer.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011948" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Acute respiratory tract infection</a></h3>
	An acute infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002099" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Asthma</a></h3>
	Asthma is characterized by increased responsiveness of the tracheobronchial tree to multiple stimuli, leading to narrowing of the air passages with resultant dyspnea, cough, and wheezing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002789" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Tachypnea</a></h3>
	Very rapid breathing.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
In adults, a beathing rate of between 12-20 breaths per minute is normal and tachypnea is present with a ventilatory rate greater than 20 breaths per minute.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002094" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dyspnea</a></h3>
	Difficult or labored breathing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012735" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cough</a></h3>
	A sudden, audible expulsion of air from the lungs through a partially closed glottis, preceded by inhalation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002105" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hemoptysis</a></h3>
	Coughing up (expectoration) of blood or blood-streaked sputum from the larynx, trachea, bronchi, or lungs.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002835" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Aspiration</a></h3>
	Inspiration of a foreign object into the airway.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000822" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypertension</a></h3>
	The presence of chronic increased pressure in the systemic arterial system.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic BP (140 mm Hg or higher), diastolic BP (90 mm Hg or higher), or both.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001681" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Angina pectoris</a></h3>
	Paroxysmal chest pain that occurs with exertion or stress and is related to myocardial ischemia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001677" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Coronary artery disease</a></h3>
	Reduction of the diameter of the coronary arteries as the result of an accumulation of atheromatous plaques within the walls of the coronary arteries, which increases the risk of myocardial ischemia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001297" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Stroke</a></h3>
	Sudden impairment of blood flow to a part of the brain due to occlusion or rupture of an artery to the brain.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000819" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Diabetes mellitus</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002625" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Deep venous thrombosis</a></h3>
	Formation of a blot clot in a deep vein. The clot often blocks blood flow, causing swelling and pain. The deep veins of the leg are most often affected.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002204" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pulmonary embolism</a></h3>
