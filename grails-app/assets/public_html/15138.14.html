	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002804" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita</a></h3>
	A non-progressive finding characterized by multiple joint contractures found throughout the body at birth.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is related to fetal akinesia owing to fetal neurogenic, muscle, or connective tissue disorders or occasionally to maternal conditions. AMC can be associated with polyhydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, micrognathia, ocular hypertelorism, and short umbilical cord. AMC is a feature of a heterogeneous group of disorders, some of which have the phrase 'arthrogryposis multiplex congenita' as a part of their name (for instance, Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, distal type 1 or AMCD1). This term refers to the finding of multiple joint contractures found throughout the body at birth rather than to the disease entities of which this is a clinical feature.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005684" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Distal arthrogryposis</a></h3>
	A form of arthrogryposis primarily affecting the hands and the feet.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100490" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Camptodactyly of finger</a></h3>
	The distal interphalangeal joint and/or the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fingers cannot be extended to 180 degrees by either active or passive extension.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that some restrict the use of the term to inability to extend the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fifth finger. We do not restrict the term in this way. This term should not be used if the patient has Clenched hand. A similar effect can be created by radial angulation within the distal phalanx with thickening of the epiphysis, which is called Kirner deformity or dystelephalangy. The affected digits should be specified.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006466" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ankle contracture</a></h3>
	A chronic loss of ankle joint motion due to structural changes in muscle, tendons, ligaments, or skin that prevent normal movement of the joints of the ankle.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003202" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Skeletal muscle atrophy</a></h3>
	The presence of skeletal muscular atrophy (which is also known as amyotrophy).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011805" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of muscle morphology</a></h3>
	A structural abnormality of a skeletal muscle.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003690" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Limb muscle weakness</a></h3>
	Reduced strength and weakness of the muscles of the arms and legs.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003327" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Axial muscle weakness</a></h3>
	Reduced strength of the axial musculature (i.e., of the muscles of the head and neck, spine, and ribs).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003473" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Fatigable weakness</a></h3>
	A type of weakness that occurs after a muscle group is used and lessens if the muscle group has some rest. That is, there is diminution of strength with repetitive muscle actions.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This type of weakness is pathognomonic for an abnormality of the neuromuscular junction such as myasthenia gravis. A characteristic form of muscular weakness that worsens after use of affected muscles. Myasthenia is caused by  failure of neuromuscular transmission, which results from the binding of autoantibodies to proteins involved in signaling at the neuromuscular junction, including especially the nicotinic acetyl choline receptor (AChR) or, less frequently, a muscle-specific tyrosine kinase involved in AChR clustering.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001558" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Decreased fetal movement</a></h3>
	An abnormal reduction in quantity or strength of fetal movements.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001561" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Polyhydramnios</a></h3>
	The presence of excess amniotic fluid in the uterus during pregnancy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Polyhydramnios is diagnosed if the deepest vertical pool of amniotic fluid is more than 8 cm or amniotic fluid index is more than 95th percentile for the corresponding gestational age.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001562" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Oligohydramnios</a></h3>
	Diminished amniotic fluid volume in pregnancy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Oligohydramnios is the opposite of polyhydramnios. In normal pregnancy the amniotic fluid volume increases by about 10 ml/day until the 34th, after which it slowly diminishes. A normal amniotic fluid volume at term is about 500-2,000 ml. Oligohydramnios is defined as an AFI (amniotic fluid index) less than 5 cm or smallest vertical pocket of fluid less than 2 cm.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001319" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neonatal hypotonia</a></h3>
	Muscular hypotonia (abnormally low muscle tone) manifesting in the neonatal period.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002540" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Inability to walk</a></h3>
	Incapability to ambulate.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004322" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short stature</a></h3>
	A height below that which is expected according to age and gender norms. Although there is no universally accepted definition of short stature, many refer to "short stature" as height more than 2 standard deviations below the mean for age and gender (or below the 3rd percentile for age and gender dependent norms).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
	Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001999" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal facial shape</a></h3>
	An abnormal morphology (form) of the face or its components.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term now covers many of the historical inexact descriptions such as Bird-like facies that probably should be avoided in modern genetics. This portion of the Ontology should be revised.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
	A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002652" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Skeletal dysplasia</a></h3>
	A general term describing features characterized by abnormal development of bones and connective tissues.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The word skeletal dysplasia is most often used to describe a group of over 380 inherited conditions that involve abnormal development of bones and connective tissues. However, the word can also be used to describe the presence of a congenital defects of bones or connective tissues that are found in one or more of the diseases, especially on prenatal ultrasound, i.e., a situation in which it is often not yet possible to make an exact etiological diagnosis. This is the sense of the phrase we use in the HPO. It is, however, preferable to annotate the observed abnormalities.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002650" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Scoliosis</a></h3>
	The presence of an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000581" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Blepharophimosis</a></h3>
	A fixed reduction in the vertical distance between the upper and lower eyelids with short palpebral fissures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
When the palpebral fissures are severely shortened, they cannot be widely separated, actively or passively.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cataract</a></h3>
	A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000175" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft palate</a></h3>
	Cleft palate is a developmental defect of the palate resulting from a failure of fusion of the palatine processes and manifesting as a separation of the roof of the mouth (soft and hard palate).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Cleft palate is a developmental defect that occurs between the 7th and 12th week of pregnancy. Normally, the palatine processes fuse during this time to form the soft and hard palate. A failure of fusion results in a cleft palate. The clinical spectrum ranges from bifid uvula, to (incomplete or complete) cleft of the soft palate, up to (complete or incomplete) cleft of both the soft and hard palate.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002093" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Respiratory insufficiency</a></h3>
	Failure to adequately provide oxygen to cells of the body and to remove excess carbon dioxide.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011675" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Arrhythmia</a></h3>
	Any cardiac rhythm other than the normal sinus rhythm. Such a rhythm may be either of sinus or ectopic origin and either regular or irregular. An arrhythmia may be due to a disturbance in impulse formation or conduction or both.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001638" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cardiomyopathy</a></h3>
	A myocardial disorder in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal, in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease and congenital heart disease sufficient to cause the observed myocardial abnormality.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001627" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of cardiac morphology</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the heart.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002060" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the cerebrum</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the telencephalon, which is also known as the cerebrum.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002500" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the cerebral white matter</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the cerebral white matter.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding can be demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging, especially with t2 signalling. The cerebral white matter is the region of the central nervous system that  consists mostly of glial cells and myelinated axons that interconnect the various regions of the cerebrum and the lower brain centers. It is located in the subcortex.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001317" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the cerebellum</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the cerebellum.
