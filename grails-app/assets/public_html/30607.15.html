  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Diagnosis of ANSD (based on evidence from ABR testing, OAEs and
tympanometry)
- Apparently non-syndromic
- Completed Visual Evoked Potentials examination
- Normal vestibulocochlear nerves and cochlear morphology on MRI scanning
- Absence of clinically apparent peripheral neuropathy</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Prematurity (&lt;37 weeks gestation or requiring &gt;48 hours NICU )
- Severe jaundice
- Known syndrome
- Peripheral neuropathy</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 - OPA1 if VEP prolonged</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

The cochlea is an inner ear structure comprised of a snail-shell like structure divided into three fluid-filled parts. Two are canals for the transmission of pressure and in the third is the organ of Corti, which detects pressure impulses and responds with electrical impulses which travel along the auditory nerve to the brain.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of the functioning of the vestibular apparatus.

Comment:
The vestibular apparatus is the nonauditory portion of the inner ear that mediates the subjective sensation of motion and spatial orientation of the head, adjusts muscular activity and body position to maintain posture, and stabilizes in space the fixation point of the eyes when the head moves, in order to provide a stable image upon the retina. The functioning of the vestibular system is often checked clinically by means of the caloric test, in which the head is tilted backward by about 60 degrees and either warm or cold water is introduced into the external auditory meatus on one side. The immediate results are usually vertigo, nausea, nystagmus, and twisting of the head and body.</p>

Comment:
An abnormal form of the antihelix, which is the curved prominence of cartilage, parallel with and in front of the helix, and which divides into the crura antihelicis, between which is a triangular depression, the fossa triangularis.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011039" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the helix</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of the helix. The helix is the outer rim of the ear that extends from the insertion of the ear on the scalp (root) to the termination of the cartilage at the earlobe.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Distortion of the course of the normal folds of the ear and the appearance of supernumerary crura and folds.

Comment:
This is distinct from Stahl ear and Shell ear, with which the term has sometimes been conflated. The appearance often changes markedly after birth.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cryptotia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Invagination of the superior part of the auricle under a fold of temporal skin.

Comment:
There are associated anomalies of the upper antihelix and crura. The upper one-third of the auricle is primarily affected and there is an inferomedial displacement of the Helical Darwin tubercle. Two types are recognized. Type I: the antihelix and superior crus are reduced in size; type II: it is the antihelix and inferior crus that are affected.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Median longitudinal ear length greater than two standard deviations above the mean and median ear width greater than two standard deviations above the mean (objective); or, apparent increase in length and width of the pinna (subjective).

Comment:
This is acknowledged to be a bundled term but retained here because of its usefulness in practice. Ear length is determined by the maximal distance from the superior aspect to the inferior aspect of the external ear. If only length is increased the term Long ear should be used.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008551" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microtia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Underdevelopment of the external ear.

Comment:
The definitions of microtia follow a widely used, surgically based, classification of ear anomalies outlined by Weerda 1988. As microtia indicates at least both decreased length and width, and in more severe forms it includes abnormal shape of structures, all forms are acknowledged to be bundled terms, but are retained here because they are well established.</p>
