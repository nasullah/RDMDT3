  <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>

  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Patient with an abnormal CSF neurotransmitter profile indicating an abnormal HVA, HIAA or pterin profile
•	Patients with symptoms suspicious of dopamine/serotonin deficiency (e.g. movement disorder, gait abnormalities, hypotonia, autonomic features and neurodevelopmental delay)</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	CSF neurotransmitter highly suggestive of a primary neurotransmitter that would warrant exclusion of this condition e.g. a CSF profile consistent with AADC deficiency would warrant AADC enzyme activity and DDC genetic testing before patient would be eligible
•	Normal CSF neurotransmitter profile
•	No clinical features of a neurotransmitter disorder</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:

•	As determined by CSF profile</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002921" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the cerebrospinal fluid</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

Comment:
The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is secreted by the choroid plexus, and flows uninterrupted throughout the central nervous system (the central cerebrospinal canal of the spinal cord and through the four interconnected cerebral ventricles in the brain).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008202" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Prolactin deficiency</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A reduced ability to secrete prolactin, a protein hormone that is secreted by lactotrophs in the anterior pituitary and that stimulates mammary gland development and milk production.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000870" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Prolactin excess</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The presence of abnormally increased levels of prolactin in the blood. Prolactin is a peptide hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland that plays a role in breast development and lactation during pregnancy.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100660" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dyskinesia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A movement disorder which consists of effects including diminished voluntary movements and the presence of involuntary movements.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001332" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dystonia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormally increased muscular tone that causes fixed abnormal postures. There is a slow, intermittent twisting motion that leads to exaggerated turning and posture of the extremities and trunk.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001288" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Gait disturbance</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The term gait disturbance can refer to any disruption of the ability to walk. In general, this can refer to neurological diseases but also fractures or other sources of pain that is triggered upon walking. However, in the current context gait disturbance refers to difficulty walking on the basis of a neurological or muscular disease.

Comment:
If possible, this term should not be used for new annotations. Rather, a more specific term should be sought.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002487" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperkinesis</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Motor hyperactivity with excessive movement of muscles of the body as a whole.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010553" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Oculogyric crisis</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An acute dystonic reaction with blepharospasm, periorbital twitches, and protracted fixed staring episodes. There may be a maximal upward deviation of the eyes in the sustained fashion. Oculogyric crisis can be triggered by a number of factors including neuroleptic medications.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001300" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Parkinsonism</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Characteristic neurologic anomaly resulting form degeneration of dopamine-generating cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain, characterized clinically by shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement and difficulty with walking and gait.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001290" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Generalized hypotonia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Generalized muscular hypotonia (abnormally low muscle tone).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.

Comment:
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.

Comment:
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001283" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Bulbar palsy</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Bulbar weakness (or bulbar palsy) refers to bilateral impairment of function of the lower cranial nerves IX, X, XI and XII, which occurs due to lower motor neuron lesion either at nuclear or fascicular level in the medulla or from bilateral lesions of the lower cranial nerves outside the brain-stem. Bulbar weakness is often associated with difficulty in chewing, weakness of the facial muscles, dysarthria, palatal weakness and regurgitation of fluids, dysphagia, and dysphonia.</p>
