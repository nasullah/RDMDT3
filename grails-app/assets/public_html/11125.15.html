  <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>

  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Radiological evidence of MED, as determined by expert skeletal dysplasia radiologist
- Clinical manifestations of MED within this context, including mild short stature, genu valgum/varum, joint hypermobility +/- brachydactyly.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Genome-wide copy number variation testing (e.g. aCGH, SNP array or other genomic microarray) showing a chromosome imbalance indicating an alternative aetiology
- MED as a feature of another skeletal dysplasia condition e.g. spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 - Genome-wide copy number variation testing (e.g. aCGH, SNP array or other genomic microarray)
  - COMP (if appropriate)</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003502" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Mild short stature</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A mild degree of short stature, more than -2 SD but not more than -3 SD from mean corrected for age and sex.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003498" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Disproportionate short stature</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A kind of short stature in which different regions of the body are shortened to differing extents.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001156" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Brachydactyly syndrome</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Digits that appear disproportionately short compared to the hand/foot. The word brachydactyly is used to describe a series of Mendelian diseases characterized by distinct patterns of shortened digits (brachydactyly types A-E). This is the sense used here, however, it is preferable to described the observed phenotypic abnormalities precisely.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009381" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short finger</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormally short finger associated with developmental hypoplasia.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001831" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short toe</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A toe that appears disproportionately short compared to the foot.

Comment:
This finding must be distinguished from digits that are of increased girth but of normal length and that of a long mid- and hind foot with normal digit lengths. The affected digits should be specified as described in the introductory comments. Note that we designate brachydactyly as a synonym, but this use of the term is distinct from the use of the same word in Bell&#39;s classification of brachdactyly.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002970" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Genu varum</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A positional abnormality marked by outward bowing of the legs in which the knees stay wide apart when a person stands with the feet and ankles together.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002857" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Genu valgum</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The legs angle inward, such that the knees are close together and the ankles far apart.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002829" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Arthralgia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Joint pain.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003418" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Back pain</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An unpleasant sensation characterized by physical discomfort (such as pricking, throbbing, or aching) localized to the back.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001288" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Gait disturbance</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The term gait disturbance can refer to any disruption of the ability to walk. In general, this can refer to neurological diseases but also fractures or other sources of pain that is triggered upon walking. However, in the current context gait disturbance refers to difficulty walking on the basis of a neurological or muscular disease.

Comment:
If possible, this term should not be used for new annotations. Rather, a more specific term should be sought.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001382" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Joint hypermobility</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The ability of a joint to move beyond its normal range of motion.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011849" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal bone ossification</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Any anomaly in the formation of bone or of a bony substance, or the conversion of fibrous tissue or of cartilage into bone or a bony substance.</p>
