<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
[See separate eligibility criteria for Neurofibromatosis type 1]<br />
<br />
A. Proband has clinical features diagnostic of Von Hippel Lindau syndrome. Samples to be obtained from proband and any affected family members, OR<br />
<br />
B. Proband has clinical features diagnostic of Neurofibromatosis type 2, AND<br />
<br />
? 1 family member (FDR, SDR) affected with NF2. Samples to be available and obtainable from proband and ? 1 affected family member<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
C. Proband has ?2 nonintradermal schwannomas, at least one with histologic confirmation, AND<br />
<br />
? 1 family member (FDR, SDR) affected by ? 2 nonintradermal schwannomas. Samples to be available and obtainable from proband and ? 1 affected family member<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
D. Proband diagnosed with glioma/meningioma/astrocytoma (aged <60, histologically confirmed)) AND<br />
? 1 family member (FDR, SDR) affected by a brain tumour of the same histology (histologically confirmed). Samples must be available and obtainable from proband and ? 1 affected family member.<br />
<br />
Unaffected individuals should not be recruited in this disorder. Recruitment should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs.

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>


<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing as below is strongly recommended PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT to allow appropriate management of families with readily detectable mutations in known disease genes: <br />
- NF2, VHL, SMARCB1 as appropriate

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009733" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Glioma</a></h3>
	The presence of a glioma, which is a neoplasm of the central nervous system originating from a glial cell (astrocytes or oligodendrocytes).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Gliomas can be classified as 1) ependymomas, 2) astrocytomas (including glioblastoma multiforme), 3 oligodendrogliomas, and 4) mixed gliomas, such as oligoastrocytomas.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009592" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Astrocytoma</a></h3>
	Astrocytoma is a neoplasm of the central nervous system derived from astrocytes. Astrocytes are a type of glial cell, and thus astrocytoma is a subtype of glioma.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002858" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Meningioma</a></h3>
	The presence of a meningioma, i.e., a benign tumor originating from the dura mater or arachnoid mater.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100008" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Schwannoma</a></h3>
	A benign nerve sheath tumor composed of Schwann cells.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Glial cells are cells that support nerve cells. Schwann cells wrap around the axon to form the myelin sheath. Schwann cells are involved in many important aspects of peripheral nerve biology; the conduction of nervous impulses along axons, nerve development and regeneration, trophic support for neurons, production of the nerve extracellular matrix and presentation of antigens to T-lymphocytes. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), Guillain-Barr?? syndrome (GBS), schwannomatosis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) are all neuropathies involving Schwann cells.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009588" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Vestibular Schwannoma</a></h3>
	A vestibular Schwannoma (also known as acoustic neuroma, acoustic neurinoma, or acoustic neurilemoma) is a benign, usually slow-growing tumor that develops from the VIIIth cranial nerve supplying the inner ear.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009737" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Lisch nodules</a></h3>
	The presence of pigmented, oval and dome-shaped raised hamartomatous nevi of the iris..
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000957" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cafe-au-lait spot</a></h3>
	Cafe-au-lait spots are hyperpigmented lesions that can vary in color from light brown to dark brown with smooth borders and having a size of 1.5 cm or more in adults and 0.5 cm or more in children.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The phrase cafe-au-lait comes from the French word for milk-coffee. A single cafe-au-lait spot can be an isolated finding in otherwise normal individuals. Multiple cafe-au-lait spots often indicate the presence of neurofibromatosis type 1 but may also be seen in other diseases including McCune-Albright syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Fanconi anemia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001920" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Renal artery stenosis</a></h3>
	The presence of stenosis of the renal artery.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000997" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Axillary freckling</a></h3>
	The presence in the axillary region (armpit) of an increased number of freckles, small circular spots on the skin that are darker than the surrounding skin because of deposits of melanin.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030052" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Inguinal freckling</a></h3>
	The presence in the inguinal region (groin) of an increased number of freckles, small circular spots on the skin that are darker than the surrounding skin because of deposits of melanin.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002650" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Scoliosis</a></h3>
	The presence of an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005864" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pseudoarthrosis</a></h3>
	A pathologic entity characterized by a developmental defect in a long bone leading to bending and pathologic fracture, with inability to form a normal bony callus with subsequent fibrous nonunion, leading to the pseudarthrosis (or "false joint").
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001067" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neurofibromas</a></h3>
	The presence of multiple cutaneous neurofibromas.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).

	An epiretinal membrane is a thin sheet of fibrous tissue that can develop on the surface of the macular area of the retina and cause a disturbance in vision. An epiretinal membrane area can develop on the thin macular area of the retin. An epiretinal membrane is also sometimes called a macular pucker, premacular fibrosis, surface wrinkling retinopathy or cellophane maculopathy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009594" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Retinal hamartoma</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009830" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Peripheral neuropathy</a></h3>
	Peripheral neuropathy is a general term for any disorder of the peripheral nervous system. The main clinical features used to classify peripheral neuropathy are distribution, type (mainly demyelinating versus mainly axonal), duration, and course.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005584" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Renal cell carcinoma</a></h3>
	A type of carcinoma of the kidney with origin in the epithelium of the proximal convoluted renal tubule.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Renal cell carcinoma (also known as hypernephroma) is the most common form of kidney cancer arising from the proximal renal tubule. The tissue of origin for renal cell carcinoma is the proximal renal tubular epithelium. Renal cell carcinoma can be classified as 1) clear cell carcinoma, 2) papillary carcinoma, 3) chromophobe renal carcinoma, and 4) collecting duct carcinoma.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001737" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pancreatic cysts</a></h3>

<br />
Comment:<br />
Pancreatic cysts are to be distinguished from pancreatic pseudocysts that do not possess a lining of mucous epithelium.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002666" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pheochromocytoma</a></h3>
	Pheochromocytomas (also known as chromaffin tumors) produce, store, and secrete catecholamines. Pheochromocytomas usually originate from the adrenal medulla but may also develop from chromaffin cells in or about sympathetic ganglia. A common symptom of pheochromocytoma is hypertension owing to release of catecholamines.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005562" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Multiple renal cysts</a></h3>
	The presence of many cysts in the kidney.
