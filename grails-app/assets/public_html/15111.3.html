	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001558" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Decreased fetal movement</a></h3>
	An abnormal reduction in quantity or strength of fetal movements.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001561" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Polyhydramnios</a></h3>
	The presence of excess amniotic fluid in the uterus during pregnancy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Polyhydramnios is diagnosed if the deepest vertical pool of amniotic fluid is more than 8 cm or amniotic fluid index is more than 95th percentile for the corresponding gestational age.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002804" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita</a></h3>
	A non-progressive finding characterized by multiple joint contractures found throughout the body at birth.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is related to fetal akinesia owing to fetal neurogenic, muscle, or connective tissue disorders or occasionally to maternal conditions. AMC can be associated with polyhydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, micrognathia, ocular hypertelorism, and short umbilical cord. AMC is a feature of a heterogeneous group of disorders, some of which have the phrase 'arthrogryposis multiplex congenita' as a part of their name (for instance, Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, distal type 1 or AMCD1). This term refers to the finding of multiple joint contractures found throughout the body at birth rather than to the disease entities of which this is a clinical feature.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001270" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Motor delay</a></h3>
	A type of Developmental delay characterized by a delay in acquiring motor skills.

	Any abnormality of the eye, including location, spacing, and intraocular abnormalities.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000508" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ptosis</a></h3>
	The upper eyelid margin is positioned 3 mm or more lower than usual and covers the superior portion of the iris (objective); or, the upper lid margin obscures at least part of the pupil (subjective).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000501" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Glaucoma</a></h3>
	Glaucoma refers loss of retinal ganglion cells in a characteristic pattern of optic neuropathy usually associated with increased intraocular pressure.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The feature that differentiates glaucoma from other causes of visual morbidity is a characteristic pattern of damage to the optic nerve head. This is most easily recognised at the superior and inferior poles of the optic disc. The vertical cup:disc ratio (VCDR) has proved to be a simple, relatively robust index of glaucomatous loss of the neuroretinal rim. As with intraocular pressure, VCDR is a continuous variable within the population.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000597" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ophthalmoparesis</a></h3>
	Ophthalmoplegia is a paralysis or weakness of one or more of the muscles that control eye movement.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000648" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Optic atrophy</a></h3>
	Atrophy of the optic nerve. Optic atrophy results from the death of the retinal ganglion cell axons that comprise the optic nerve and manifesting as a pale optic nerve on fundoscopy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The diagnosis of optic atrophy is made when the optic disc loses its normal orange-pink color. Optic atrophy is an end stage that arises from myriad causes of optic nerve damage anywhere along the path from the retina to the lateral geniculate. Some of the most common etiologies are advanced glaucoma, optic neuritis, arteritic or non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy or a compressive lesion.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cataract</a></h3>
	A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000405" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Conductive hearing impairment</a></h3>
	An abnormality of vibrational conductance of sound to the inner ear leading to impairment of sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
A conductive hearing impariment with greater than 90 dB loss.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000407" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sensorineural hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A type of hearing impairment  in one or both ears related to an abnormal functionality of the cochlear nerve.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss caused by damage or dysfunction of the auditory nerve (cranial nerve VIII, also known as the cochlear nerve).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000410" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Mixed hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A type of hearing loss resulting from a combination of conductive hearing impairment and sensorineural hearing impairment.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001347" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperreflexia</a></h3>
	Hyperreflexia is the presence of hyperactive stretch reflexes of the muscles.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Reflexes are graded according to the following scale: 0=absent; 1=present but diminished; 2=normoactive; 3=exaggerated; and 4=clonus. Clonus is always abnormal, and a grade 3 reflex may be abnormal if it is asymmetric or if it was previously grade 2 or less.

<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000726" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dementia</a></h3>
	A loss of global cognitive ability of sufficient amount to interfere with normal social or occupational function. Dementia represents a loss of previously present cognitive abilities, generally in adults, and can affect memory, thinking, language, judgment, and behavior.

	An abnormal shift in patterns of thinking, acting, or feeling.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term refers to changes in personality that are perceived as being abnormal. It does not refer to the usual gradual personality changes that tend to accompany aging and certain life situations.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000708" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Behavioral abnormality</a></h3>
	An abnormality of mental functioning including various affective, behavioural, cognitive and perceptual abnormalities.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001251" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ataxia</a></h3>
	Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- oder overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Ataxia can be differentiated into dyssynergy, asynergy, dysmetria (hypometria, hypermetria), dysdiadochokinesis, gait ataxia, truncal ataxia, limb ataxia, and dysarthria). Note: This term does not include sensory ataxia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001266" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Choreoathetosis</a></h3>
	Involuntary movements characterized by both athetosis (inability to sustain muscles in a fixed position) and chorea (widespread jerky arrhythmic movements).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011097" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Epileptic spasms</a></h3>
	A sudden flexion, extension or mixed extension-flexion of predominantly proximal and truncal muscles which is usually more sustained than a myoclonic movement but not as sustained as a tonic seizure.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The maximum age of onset is between 3 and 12 months, the peak being at 6 months. However, spasms may start from birth, or appear long after the age of 12 months, including into adulthood. Infantile spasms represent a specific type of seizure seen in an epilepsy syndrome of infancy and childhood known as West Syndrome. West Syndrome is characterized by infantile spasms, developmental regression, and hypsarrhythmia (as demonstrated by electroencephalography).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003202" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Skeletal muscle atrophy</a></h3>
	The presence of skeletal muscular atrophy (which is also known as amyotrophy).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002380" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Fasciculations</a></h3>
	Fasciculations are observed as small, local, involuntary muscle contractions (twitching) visible under the skin. Fasciculations result from increased irritability of an axon (which in turn is often a manifestation of disease of a motor neuron). This leads to sporadic discharges of all the muscle fibers controlled by the axon in isolation from other motor units.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding can be visible clinically and can be demonstrated by electromyography (EMG).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008948" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Proximal upper limb amyotrophy</a></h3>

	An abnormality of the skeleton of foot.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
A disorder of the foot that can either be congenital or acquired. Such deformities can include hammer toe, club foot deformity, flat feet, pes cavus, congenital vertical talus (rocker bottom foot), and many others.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001763" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pes planus</a></h3>
	A foot where the plantar arch is in contact with the ground or floor when the individual is standing; or, in a patient lying supine, a foot where the arch is in contact with the surface of a flat board pressed against the sole of the foot by the examiner with a pressure similar to that expected from weight bearing; or, the height of the arch is reduced.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001761" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pes cavus</a></h3>

	A foot deformity resulting due to an abnormality affecting the bones of the foot (as well as muscle and soft tissue). In contrast if only the muscle and soft tissue are affected the term positional foot deformity applies.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001324" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Muscle weakness</a></h3>
	Reduced strength of muscles.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
It is important clinical to distinguish between muscle weakness, fatigue, and asthenia. Fatigue describes the inability to continue performing a task after multiple repetitions; in contrast, a patient with primary weakness is unable to perform the first repetition of the task. Asthenia is a sense of weariness or exhaustion in the absence of muscle weakness. Conditions that result in intrinsic muscle weakness can be divided into several main categories: infectious, neurologic, endocrine, inflammatory, rheumatologic, genetic, metabolic, electrolyte-induced, or drug-induced.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003473" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Fatigable weakness</a></h3>
	A type of weakness that occurs after a muscle group is used and lessens if the muscle group has some rest. That is, there is diminution of strength with repetitive muscle actions.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This type of weakness is pathognomonic for an abnormality of the neuromuscular junction such as myasthenia gravis. A characteristic form of muscular weakness that worsens after use of affected muscles. Myasthenia is caused by  failure of neuromuscular transmission, which results from the binding of autoantibodies to proteins involved in signaling at the neuromuscular junction, including especially the nicotinic acetyl choline receptor (AChR) or, less frequently, a muscle-specific tyrosine kinase involved in AChR clustering.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010829" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired temperature sensation</a></h3>
	A reduced ability to discriminate between different temperatures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Temperature sensation can be tested by touching the skin several seconds with a water flask filled to the desired temperature. Persons with normal temperature sensation should at least be able to identify as warm a flask that is 35-36 degrees C and identify as cool a flask at 28-32 degrees C.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007328" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired pain sensation</a></h3>
	Reduced ability to perceive painful stimuli.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010831" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired proprioception</a></h3>
	A loss or impairment of the sensation of the relative position of parts of the body and joint position.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002495" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired vibratory sensation</a></h3>
	A decrease in the ability to perceive vibration. Clinically, this is usually tested with a tuning fork which vibrates at 128 Hz and is applied to bony prominences such as the malleoli at the ankles or the metacarpal-phalangeal joints. There is a slow decay of vibration from the tuning fork. The degree of vibratory sense loss can be crudely estimated by counting the number of seconds that the examiner can perceive the vibration longer than the patient.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Impaired vibratory sensation may suggesti involvement of the posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway, which is responsible for transmitting fine touch, vibration and conscious proprioceptive information from the body to the cerebral cortex.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003445" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: neuropathic changes</a></h3>
	The presence of characteristic findings of denervation on electromyography (fibrillations, positive sharp waves, and giant motor unit potentials).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This is a bundled term. It is preferable to annotate the precise clinical observations, but the term is kept now for convenience.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100283" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: continuous motor unit activity at rest</a></h3>
	Continuous electromyographic activity of motor units at rest, i.e., without voluntary movement of the muscles.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The motor unit contains an anterior horn cell, its axon, and all of the muscle fibers that it innervates via the neuromuscular junction. Note that a healthy relaxed muscle does not show significant EMG activity at rest.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010546" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Muscle fibrillation</a></h3>
	Fine, rapid twitching of individual muscle fibers with little or no movement of the muscle as a whole. If a motor neuron or its axon is destroyed, the muscle fibers it innervates undergo denervation atrophy. This leads to hypersensitivity of individual muscle fibers to acetyl choline so that they may contract spontaneously. Isolated activity of individual muscle fibers is generally so fine it cannot be seen through the intact skin, although it can be recorded as a short-duration spike in the EMG.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003730" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: myotonic runs</a></h3>
	Spontaneous, repetitive electrical activity demonstrated by electromyography (EMG).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This is a characteristic abnormality seen in the myotonias and periodic paralyses.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003482" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: axonal abnormality</a></h3>
	Electromyographic (EMG) findings characteristic of axonal neuropathy, with normal or slightly decreased nerve conduction velocities,  normal or slightly prolonged distal latencies, but significantly reduced motor potentials and sensory amplitudes. There may be spontaneous activity upon needle EMG studies, such as increased insertional activity, positive sharp waves, and fibrillation potentials.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This is a bundled term that is kept for convenience. It is preferable to record the precise clinical observations.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100285" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: impaired neuromuscular transmission</a></h3>
	An electromyographic finding associated with erratic or absent neuromuscular transmission with erratic, moment-to-moment changes in the shape of the motor unit potential (MUP).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007002" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Motor axonal neuropathy</a></h3>
	Progressive impairment of function of motor axons with muscle weakness, atrophy, and cramps. The deficits are length-dependent, meaning that muscles innervated by the longest nerves are affected first, so that for instance the arms are affected at a later age than the onset of deficits involving the lower leg.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Distal motor neuropathy is a bundled term that should not be used if more detailed information about the phenotype is available.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007220" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Demyelinating motor neuropathy</a></h3>
	Demyelination of peripheral motor nerves.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Demyelinating motor neuropathy demonstrates slow motor nerve conduction velocities with reduced amplitudes of motor nerve conduction and prolonged distal latencies.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003448" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Decreased sensory nerve conduction velocity</a></h3>
	Reduced speed of conduction of the action potential along a sensory nerve.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) in response to electrical stimulation is recorded from the nerve itself by means of dermal recording electrodes. The SNAP is the sum of all the action potentials generated in sensory nerve fibres by the applied electrical impulse.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003403" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: decremental response of compound muscle action potential to repetitive nerve stimulation</a></h3>
	A compound muscle action potential (CMAP) is a type of electromyography (EMG). CMAP refers to a group of almost simultaneous action potentials from several muscle fibers in the same area evoked by stimulation of the supplying motor nerve and are recorded as one multipeaked summated action potential. This abnormality refers to a greater than normal decrease in the amplitude during the course of the investigation.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The result of this test is abnormal if progressively fewer muscle fibers respond to nerve stimulation during a train of stimuli, thereby yielding a decrementing pattern in the CMAP.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000775" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the diaphragm</a></h3>
	Any abnormality of the diaphragm.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006597" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Diaphragmatic paralysis</a></h3>
	The presence of a paralyzed diaphragm.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Loss of the ability to move the diaphragm for respiratory motions. Patients with complete diaphragm paralysis complain of gross orthopnoea, disturbed sleep and early morning headaches. They have shortness of breath on minimal exertion and, because they sleep poorly, they experience daytime fatigue.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009113" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Diaphragmatic weakness</a></h3>
	A decrease in the strength of the diaphragm.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Diaphragmatic paralysis is an extreme form of diaphragmatic weakness. Weakness of the diaphragm can result from abnormalities at any site along its neuromuscular axis, although it most frequently arises from diseases in the phrenic nerves or from myopathies affecting the diaphragm itself. Presence of diaphragmatic weakness may be suspected from the complaint of dyspnea (particularly on exertion) or orthopnea; or the presence of rapid, shallow breathing or, more importantly, paradoxical inward motion of the abdomen during inspiration on physical examination.

	An elevation of the level of the enzyme creatine kinase (also known as creatine phosphokinase, CPK; EC 2.7.3.2) in the blood. CPK levels can be elevated in a number of clinical disorders such as myocardial infarction, rhabdomyolysis, and muscular dystrophy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012785" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Flexion contracture of finger</a></h3>
	Chronic loss of joint motion in a finger due to structural changes in non-bony tissue.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that the term camptodactyly refers to a painless flexion contracture of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint and not to a finger joint contracture in general.
