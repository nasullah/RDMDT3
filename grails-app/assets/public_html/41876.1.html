  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">A. Chronic visceral dilatation including part or all of the small intestine (chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction)

AND one of:

B1. Diagnosis within first year of life (majority will have symptoms from the neonatal period)
B2. Diagnosis at any age but with at least one first or second degree relative with a diagnosis of either IPO or another severe digestive motility disorder (enteric dysmotility; oesophageal achalasia, megacolon, megarectum).

Individuals with severe or syndromic disease should be recruited according to standard guidance, typically as trios. Disease status of apparently unaffected participants should be determined according to standard clinical practice to detect cryptic disease.

In other cases, unaffected individuals should not be recruited. Recruitment in such families should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Proven mitochondrial myopathy (MNGIE) [by MRI / muscle biopsy in suspected cases]
Proven early onset secondary cause e.g. muscular dystrophy or cystic fibrosis [with relevant testing if clinical suspicion]</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice: 
 No genes specified</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

Comment:
Abnormal enlargement of the fetal bladder can be detected by prenatal ultrasound by fourteen weeks of gestation. In some cases, dilatation of the fetal bladder is transient and resolves without sequelae, and in other cases it is the earliest manifestation of bladder outlet obstruction.</p>

Comment:
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.

Comment:
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002126" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Polymicrogyria</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A congenital abnormality of the cerebral hemisphere characterized by an excessive number of small gyri (convolutions) on the surface of the brain.

Comment:
Polymicrogyria, one of the most common malformations of cortical development, is characterized histologically by the appearance of an excessive number of small cortical folds, often fused together, with disordered cortical lamination.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A form of gray matter heterotopia were the mislocalized gray matter is typically located periventricularly, also sometimes called subependymal heterotopia. Periventricular means beside the ventricles. This is by far the most common location for heterotopia. Subependymal heterotopia present in a wide array of variations. There can be a small single node or a large number of nodes, can exist on either or both sides of the brain at any point along the higher ventricle margins, can be small or large, single or multiple, and can form a small node or a large wavy or curved mass.

Comment:
Periventricular gray matter heterotopia can be seen for example in patients with Smith-Lemli-Opitz-Syndrome.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001321" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebellar hypoplasia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Underdevelopment of the cerebellum.

Comment:
By prenatal ultrasound, cerebellar hypoplasia is diagnosed if the cerebellum measures more than two standard deviations below the mean. In adults, cerebellar hypoplasia is typically diagnosed by computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebellar hypoplasia can be diagnosed if there is a small cerebellum with fissures of normal size compared with the folia (this is a distinguishing characteristic compared with cerebellar atrophy).</p>
