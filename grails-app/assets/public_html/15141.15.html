  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Ocular coloboma taken to represent failure of the optic fissure to close with awide spectrum of clinical severity asa consequence of variation in the site and extent of the closure defect.  
- Unilateral or bilaterally affected individuals.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.

Comment:
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A kind of congenital cataract that is characterized by a hollow sphere of punctate opacities involving the fetal nucleus and that usually occurs bilaterally.

Comment:
The word &quot;pulverulent &quot; means dust-like and refers to the dustlike appearance of the punctate opacities in this type of cataract. The word pulverulent refers to the very small size of the punctate opacities (like flecks of dust) rather than to a dust-like color.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007700" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anterior segment dysgenesis</a></h3>

Comment:
Preauricular cysts and sinuses are ectodermal remnants from an aberrant development of the auditory tubercles, tend to be bilateral and are localized anterior to the tragus of the ear. The preauricular sinus is a benign congenital lesion of the preauricular soft tissue consisting of a blind-ending narrow tube or pit. It is also known as preauricular pit, preauricular fistula, preauricular tract and preauricular cyst. It can be asymptomatic or present as an infected and discharging sinus. It presents as a small pit adjacent to the external ear usually located at the anterior margin of the ascending limb of the helix. The preauricular sinus is variably also termed a preauricular pit, preauricular fistula, preauricular tract and preauricular cyst.</p>

Comment:
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Facial nerve palsy is a dysfunction of cranial nerve VII (the facial nerve) that results in inability to control facial muscles on the affected side with weakness of the muscles of facial expression and eye closure. This can either be present in unilateral or bilateral form.

Comment:
Several conditions can cause a facial paralysis, e.g. brain tumor, stroke, and Lyme disease. However, if no specific cause can be identified, the condition is known as Bell&#39;s palsy. Named after Scottish anatomist Charles Bell, who first described it. Bell&#39;s palsy is the most common acute mononeuropathy (disease involving only one nerve) and is the most common cause of acute facial nerve paralysis.</p>

In cleft palate, there is a congenital failure of the palate to fuse properly, forming a grooved depression or fissure in the roof of the mouth. Clefts of the lip and palate can occur individually or together. It is preferable to code each defect separately.</p>
