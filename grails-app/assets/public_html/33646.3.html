						<!-- <h2>Generalised pustular psoriasis eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Presence of primary, sterile, macroscopically visible epidermal pustules on non-acral skin<br />
•	More than one episode of acute pustulation<br />
•	Diagnosis confirmed by consultant dermatologist

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Cases where pustulation is restricted to psoriatic plaques

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>


<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100847" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Palmoplantar pustulosis</a></h3>
	A chronic, relapsing, pustular eruption that is localized to the palms and soles.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
There are recurrent and painful eruptions of pustules on the palms and the soles of feet that may resolve with red'brown discoloration.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100871" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the palm</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the palm, that is, of the front of the hand.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100872" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the plantar skin of foot</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the plantar part of foot, that is of the soles of the feet.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008404" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nail dystrophy</a></h3>
	Onychodystrophy (nail dystrophy) refers to nail changes apart from changes of the color (nail dyschromia) and involves partial or complete disruption of the various keratinous layers of the nail plate.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Onychodystrophy is a widely used, yet rarely defined term. Onychodystrophy can be caused by congenital nail diseases, systemic disorders, fungal and nonfungal infections, various noninfectious inflammatory dermatologic diseases of the nail unit and tumors. Onychodystrophy can also occur secondarily to systemic drug use.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008392" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Subungual hyperkeratosis</a></h3>
	A thickening of the stratum corneum in the region beneath the nails.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008390" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent loss of toenails and fingernails</a></h3>
	Recurrent loss, or shedding, of the nails of the fingers and toes.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002829" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Arthralgia</a></h3>
	Joint pain.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002797" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Osteolysis</a></h3>
	Osteolysis refers to the destruction of bone through bone resorption with removal or loss of calcium.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Osteolysis may be a feature of neoplastic, infectious, metabolis, vascular, and joint disorders and is also a component of many hereditary diseases. Osteolysis may be highly localized or more diffuse. This term is meant to group the more specific osteolysis terms.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012431" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Episodic fatigue</a></h3>
	Intermittent and recurrent bouts of a subjective feeling of tiredness characterized by a lack of energy and motivation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001954" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Episodic fever</a></h3>
	Periodic (episodic or recurrent) bouts of fever.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should not be used for new annotations. Rather, the frequency of patients with the disease who have recurrent episodes of fever should be noted in the annotation file. This term will be obsoleted in the future.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011227" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Elevated C-reactive protein level</a></h3>
	An abnormal elevation of the C-reactive protein level in serum.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
C-reactive protein (CRP) is produced by the liver, and increases in concentration in response to inflammation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011893" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal leukocyte count</a></h3>
	Number of leukocytes per volume of blood beyond normal limits.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002608" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Celiac disease</a></h3>
	Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune condition affecting the small intestine, triggered by the ingestion of gluten, the protein fraction of wheat, barley, and rye. Clinical manifestations of CD are highly variable and include both gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal features. The hallmark of CD is an immune-mediated enteropathy. This term is included because the occurence of CD is seen as a feature of a number of other diseases.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001677" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Coronary artery disease</a></h3>
	Reduction of the diameter of the coronary arteries as the result of an accumulation of atheromatous plaques within the walls of the coronary arteries, which increases the risk of myocardial ischemia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004972" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Elevated mean arterial pressure</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000819" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Diabetes mellitus</a></h3>
	A group of abnormalities characterized by hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000820" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the thyroid gland</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the thyroid gland.
