  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Proband with unexplained documented VF cardiac arrest despite comprehensive clinical evaluation 

PLUS EITHER 

A. Juvenile sporadic VF (Age 1-18 years). Recruitment should be as trios.

OR 

B. Idiopathic VF aged 1-45 years with family history of idiopathic VF or SADS in a first, second or third degree relative. In category B, unaffected individuals should not be recruited. Recruitment in such families should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs.

Disease status of apparently unaffected participants should be determined according to standard clinical practice to detect cryptic disease.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Age of disease &lt;1 or &gt;45y in proband or qualifying relative, OR
Known inherited arrhythmogenic disorder identified on clinical evaluation</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice: 
 No genes specified</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001663" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ventricular fibrillation</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Uncontrolled contractions of muscles fibers in the left ventricle not producing contraction of the left ventricle. Ventricular fibrillation usually begins with a ventricular premature contraction and a short run of rapid ventricular tachycardia degenerating into uncoordinating ventricular fibrillations.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001645" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sudden cardiac death</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating resulting in death within a short time period (generally within 1 h of symptom onset).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001279" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Syncope</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Syncope refers to a generalized weakness of muscles with loss of postural tone, inability to stand upright, and loss of consciousness. Once the patient is in a horizontal position, blood flow to the brain is no longer hindered by gravitation and consciousness is regained. Unconsciousness usually lasts for seconds to minutes. Headache and drowsiness (which usually follow seizures) do not follow a syncopal attack. Syncope results from a sudden impairment of brain metabolism usually due to a reduction in cerebral blood flow.</p>
