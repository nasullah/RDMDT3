	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001511" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intrauterine growth retardation</a></h3>
	An abnormal restriction of fetal growth with fetal weight below the tenth percentile for gestational age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Intrauterine growth restriction is a newer term that is preferred over Intrauterine growth retardation. The causes of IUGR include maternal abnormalities (chronic hypertension, cyanotic heart disease, smoking, drug abuse), placental or umbilical cord abnormalities (including placenta previa and cord anomalies), maternal medicationas, and genetic disorders of the fetus.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001558" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Decreased fetal movement</a></h3>
	An abnormal reduction in quantity or strength of fetal movements.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001561" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Polyhydramnios</a></h3>
	The presence of excess amniotic fluid in the uterus during pregnancy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Polyhydramnios is diagnosed if the deepest vertical pool of amniotic fluid is more than 8 cm or amniotic fluid index is more than 95th percentile for the corresponding gestational age.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002804" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita</a></h3>
	A non-progressive finding characterized by multiple joint contractures found throughout the body at birth.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is related to fetal akinesia owing to fetal neurogenic, muscle, or connective tissue disorders or occasionally to maternal conditions. AMC can be associated with polyhydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, micrognathia, ocular hypertelorism, and short umbilical cord. AMC is a feature of a heterogeneous group of disorders, some of which have the phrase 'arthrogryposis multiplex congenita' as a part of their name (for instance, Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, distal type 1 or AMCD1). This term refers to the finding of multiple joint contractures found throughout the body at birth rather than to the disease entities of which this is a clinical feature.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001371" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Flexion contracture</a></h3>
	A flexion contracture is a bent (flexed) joint that cannot be straightened actively or passively. It is thus a chronic loss of joint motion due to structural changes in muscle, tendons, ligaments, or skin that prevents normal movement of joints.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004348" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of bone mineral density</a></h3>
	This term applies to all changes in bone mineral density which (depending on severity) can be seen on x-rays as a change in density and or structure of the bone. Changes may affect all bones of the organism, just certain bones or only parts of bones and include decreased mineralisation as may be seen in osteoporosis or increased mineralisation and or ossification as in osteopetrosis, exostoses or any kind of atopic calicfications of different origin and distribution. The overall amount of mineralization of the bone-organ can be measured as the amount of matter per cubic centimeter of bones, usually measured by densitometry of the lumbar spine or hip. The measurements are usually reported as g/cm3 or as a Z-score (the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for the patient's age and sex). Note that measurement with this method does not reflect local changes in other bones, and as such might not be correct with regard the hole bone-organ.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000501" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Glaucoma</a></h3>
	Glaucoma refers loss of retinal ganglion cells in a characteristic pattern of optic neuropathy usually associated with increased intraocular pressure.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The feature that differentiates glaucoma from other causes of visual morbidity is a characteristic pattern of damage to the optic nerve head. This is most easily recognised at the superior and inferior poles of the optic disc. The vertical cup:disc ratio (VCDR) has proved to be a simple, relatively robust index of glaucomatous loss of the neuroretinal rim. As with intraocular pressure, VCDR is a continuous variable within the population.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000597" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ophthalmoparesis</a></h3>
	Ophthalmoplegia is a paralysis or weakness of one or more of the muscles that control eye movement.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000648" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Optic atrophy</a></h3>
	Atrophy of the optic nerve. Optic atrophy results from the death of the retinal ganglion cell axons that comprise the optic nerve and manifesting as a pale optic nerve on fundoscopy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The diagnosis of optic atrophy is made when the optic disc loses its normal orange-pink color. Optic atrophy is an end stage that arises from myriad causes of optic nerve damage anywhere along the path from the retina to the lateral geniculate. Some of the most common etiologies are advanced glaucoma, optic neuritis, arteritic or non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy or a compressive lesion.

	Pallor of the perifoveal macula of the retina with appearance of a small circular reddish choroid shape as seen through the fovea centralis due to relative transparancy of the macula.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cataract</a></h3>
	A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000519" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Congenital cataract</a></h3>
	A congenital cataract.<br />

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000405" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Conductive hearing impairment</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001324" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Muscle weakness</a></h3>
	Reduced strength of muscles.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
It is important clinical to distinguish between muscle weakness, fatigue, and asthenia. Fatigue describes the inability to continue performing a task after multiple repetitions; in contrast, a patient with primary weakness is unable to perform the first repetition of the task. Asthenia is a sense of weariness or exhaustion in the absence of muscle weakness. Conditions that result in intrinsic muscle weakness can be divided into several main categories: infectious, neurologic, endocrine, inflammatory, rheumatologic, genetic, metabolic, electrolyte-induced, or drug-induced.

	Decreased strength of the neck musculature.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003327" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Axial muscle weakness</a></h3>
	Reduced strength of the axial musculature (i.e., of the muscles of the head and neck, spine, and ribs).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001315" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Reduced tendon reflexes</a></h3>
	Diminution of tendon reflexes, which is an invariable sign of peripheral nerve disease.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The deep tendon reflex is a monosynaptic reflex arc with sensory and motor nerve components, but the arc is much more vulnerable to sensory nerve damage. Ankle plantar flexion is retained in all but the most severe peripheral neuropathies, and thus loss of the Achilles tendon reflex in an objective indication of a substantial sensory nerve defect.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001284" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Areflexia</a></h3>
	Absence of neurologic reflexes such as the knee-jerk reaction.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The strectch reflexes (also called deep tendon relfexes) include the knee-jerk reflex (patellar reflex, the biceps reflex, the triceps reflex, and the ankle jerk reflex or Achilles tendon reflex).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001276" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypertonia</a></h3>
	A condition in which there is increased muscle tone so that arms or legs, for example, are stiff and difficult to move.  <br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Spasticity is a term that is often used interchangeably with hypertonia.  Spasticity, however, is a particular type of hypertonia in which the muscles' spasms are increased by movement.  In this type, patients usually have exaggerated reflex responses.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006829" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Severe muscular hypotonia</a></h3>
	A severe degree of muscular hypotonia characterized by markedly reduced muscle tone.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Muscular hypotonia</a></h3>
	Muscular hypotonia is an abnormally low muscle tone (the amount of tension or resistance to movement in a muscle), often involving reduced muscle strength. Hypotonia is characterized by a diminished resistance to passive stretching.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001332" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dystonia</a></h3>
	An abnormally increased muscular tone that causes fixed abnormal postures. There is a slow, intermittent twisting motion that leads to exaggerated turning and posture of the extremities and trunk.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001337" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Tremor</a></h3>
	An unintentional, oscillating to-and-fro muscle movement.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Tremor is differentiated from other involuntary movement disorders, such as chorea, athetosis, ballism, tics, and myoclonus, by its repetitive, stereotyped movements of a regular amplitude and frequency. Clonus, unlike tremor, represents a rhythmic movement, which is increased by muscle stretching.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002174" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Postural tremor</a></h3>
	A type of tremors that is triggered by holding a limb in a fixed position.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002322" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Resting tremor</a></h3>
	A resting tremor occurs when muscles are at rest and becomes less noticeable or disappears when the affected muscles are moved. Resting tremors are often slow and coarse.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002080" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intention tremor</a></h3>
	A type of kinetic tremor that occurs during target directed movement is called intention tremor. That is, an oscillatory cerebellar ataxia that tends to be absent when the limbs are inactive and during the first part of voluntary movement but worsening as the movement continues and greater precision is required (e.g., in touching a target such as the patient's nose or a physician's finger).

	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000726" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dementia</a></h3>
	A loss of global cognitive ability of sufficient amount to interfere with normal social or occupational function. Dementia represents a loss of previously present cognitive abilities, generally in adults, and can affect memory, thinking, language, judgment, and behavior.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000751" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Personality changes</a></h3>
	An abnormal shift in patterns of thinking, acting, or feeling.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term refers to changes in personality that are perceived as being abnormal. It does not refer to the usual gradual personality changes that tend to accompany aging and certain life situations.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000708" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Behavioral abnormality</a></h3>
	An abnormality of mental functioning including various affective, behavioural, cognitive and perceptual abnormalities.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001251" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ataxia</a></h3>
	Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- oder overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Ataxia can be differentiated into dyssynergy, asynergy, dysmetria (hypometria, hypermetria), dysdiadochokinesis, gait ataxia, truncal ataxia, limb ataxia, and dysarthria). Note: This term does not include sensory ataxia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002878" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Respiratory failure</a></h3>
	A severe form of respiratory insufficiency characterized by inadequate gas exchange such that the levels of oxygen or carbon dioxide cannot be maintained within normal limits.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Respiratory failure is classified as type 1 with hypoxemia (arterial partial pressure of oxygen less than 60 mmHg) without hypercapnea, and type 2 with hypoxemia in the present of hypercapnea (partial pressure of carbon dioxide over 50 mmHg).

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011675" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Arrhythmia</a></h3>
	Any cardiac rhythm other than the normal sinus rhythm. Such a rhythm may be either of sinus or ectopic origin and either regular or irregular. An arrhythmia may be due to a disturbance in impulse formation or conduction or both.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001638" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cardiomyopathy</a></h3>
	A myocardial disorder in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal, in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease and congenital heart disease sufficient to cause the observed myocardial abnormality.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003457" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG abnormality</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003458" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: myopathic abnormalities</a></h3>
	The presence of abnormal electromyographic patterns indicative of myopathy, such as small-short polyphasic motor unit potentials.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003445" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: neuropathic changes</a></h3>
	The presence of characteristic findings of denervation on electromyography (fibrillations, positive sharp waves, and giant motor unit potentials).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This is a bundled term. It is preferable to annotate the precise clinical observations, but the term is kept now for convenience.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100283" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: continuous motor unit activity at rest</a></h3>
	Continuous electromyographic activity of motor units at rest, i.e., without voluntary movement of the muscles.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The motor unit contains an anterior horn cell, its axon, and all of the muscle fibers that it innervates via the neuromuscular junction. Note that a healthy relaxed muscle does not show significant EMG activity at rest.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010546" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Muscle fibrillation</a></h3>
	Fine, rapid twitching of individual muscle fibers with little or no movement of the muscle as a whole. If a motor neuron or its axon is destroyed, the muscle fibers it innervates undergo denervation atrophy. This leads to hypersensitivity of individual muscle fibers to acetyl choline so that they may contract spontaneously. Isolated activity of individual muscle fibers is generally so fine it cannot be seen through the intact skin, although it can be recorded as a short-duration spike in the EMG.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003730" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: myotonic runs</a></h3>
	Spontaneous, repetitive electrical activity demonstrated by electromyography (EMG).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This is a characteristic abnormality seen in the myotonias and periodic paralyses.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100285" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: impaired neuromuscular transmission</a></h3>
	An electromyographic finding associated with erratic or absent neuromuscular transmission with erratic, moment-to-moment changes in the shape of the motor unit potential (MUP).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007002" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Motor axonal neuropathy</a></h3>
	Progressive impairment of function of motor axons with muscle weakness, atrophy, and cramps. The deficits are length-dependent, meaning that muscles innervated by the longest nerves are affected first, so that for instance the arms are affected at a later age than the onset of deficits involving the lower leg.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Distal motor neuropathy is a bundled term that should not be used if more detailed information about the phenotype is available.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007220" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Demyelinating motor neuropathy</a></h3>
	Demyelination of peripheral motor nerves.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Demyelinating motor neuropathy demonstrates slow motor nerve conduction velocities with reduced amplitudes of motor nerve conduction and prolonged distal latencies.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003448" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Decreased sensory nerve conduction velocity</a></h3>
	Reduced speed of conduction of the action potential along a sensory nerve.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) in response to electrical stimulation is recorded from the nerve itself by means of dermal recording electrodes. The SNAP is the sum of all the action potentials generated in sensory nerve fibres by the applied electrical impulse.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003390" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sensory axonal neuropathy</a></h3>
	An axonal neuropathy of peripheral sensory nerves.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011402" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Demyelinating sensory neuropathy</a></h3>
	Demyelination of peripheral sensory nerves.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003403" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: decremental response of compound muscle action potential to repetitive nerve stimulation</a></h3>
	A compound muscle action potential (CMAP) is a type of electromyography (EMG). CMAP refers to a group of almost simultaneous action potentials from several muscle fibers in the same area evoked by stimulation of the supplying motor nerve and are recorded as one multipeaked summated action potential. This abnormality refers to a greater than normal decrease in the amplitude during the course of the investigation.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The result of this test is abnormal if progressively fewer muscle fibers respond to nerve stimulation during a train of stimuli, thereby yielding a decrementing pattern in the CMAP.
