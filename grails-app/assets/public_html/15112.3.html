	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000478" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the eye</a></h3>
	Any abnormality of the eye, including location, spacing, and intraocular abnormalities.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000570" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of saccadic eye movements</a></h3>
	An abnormality of eye movement characterized by impairment of fast (saccadic) eye movements.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Fast (saccadic) eye movements comprise voluntary or involuntary refixation movements, the fast phase of vestibular nystagmus, optokinetic nystagmus, and microsaccades.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000597" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ophthalmoparesis</a></h3>
	Ophthalmoplegia is a paralysis or weakness of one or more of the muscles that control eye movement.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000514" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Slow saccadic eye movements</a></h3>
	An abnormally slow velocity of the saccadic eye movements.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Saccades are rapid eye movements that align the fovea with the target.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000641" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dysmetric saccades</a></h3>
	The controller signal for saccadic eye movements has two components: the pulse that moves the eye rapidly from one point to the next, and the step that holds the eye in the new position. When both the pulse and the step are not the correct size, a dysmetric refixation eye movement results.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000648" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Optic atrophy</a></h3>
	Atrophy of the optic nerve. Optic atrophy results from the death of the retinal ganglion cell axons that comprise the optic nerve and manifesting as a pale optic nerve on fundoscopy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The diagnosis of optic atrophy is made when the optic disc loses its normal orange-pink color. Optic atrophy is an end stage that arises from myriad causes of optic nerve damage anywhere along the path from the retina to the lateral geniculate. Some of the most common etiologies are advanced glaucoma, optic neuritis, arteritic or non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy or a compressive lesion.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000511" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Vertical supranuclear gaze palsy</a></h3>
	A supranuclear gaze palsy is an inability to look in a vertical direction as a result of cerebral impairment. There is a loss of the voluntary aspect of eye movements, but, as the brainstem is still intact, all the reflex conjugate eye movements are normal.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002019" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Constipation</a></h3>
	Infrequent or difficult evacuation of feces.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000458" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anosmia</a></h3>
	An inability to perceive odors. This is a general term describing inability to smell arising in any part of the process of smelling from absorption of odorants into the nasal mucous overlying the olfactory epithelium, diffusion to the cilia, binding to olfactory receptor sites, generation of action potentials in olfactory neurons, and perception of a smell.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001278" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Orthostatic hypotension</a></h3>
	A form of hypotension characterized by a sudden fall in blood pressure that occurs when a person assumes a standing position.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000020" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Urinary incontinence</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003202" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Skeletal muscle atrophy</a></h3>
	The presence of skeletal muscular atrophy (which is also known as amyotrophy).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002380" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Fasciculations</a></h3>
	Fasciculations are observed as small, local, involuntary muscle contractions (twitching) visible under the skin. Fasciculations result from increased irritability of an axon (which in turn is often a manifestation of disease of a motor neuron). This leads to sporadic discharges of all the muscle fibers controlled by the axon in isolation from other motor units.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This finding can be visible clinically and can be demonstrated by electromyography (EMG).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008948" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Proximal upper limb amyotrophy</a></h3>
	Muscular atrophy affecting proximally located muscles of the arms.

	Muscular atrophy affecting proximally located muscles of the legs, i.e., of the thigh.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007149" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Distal upper limb amyotrophy</a></h3>
	Muscular atrophy of distal arm muscles.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008944" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Distal lower limb amyotrophy</a></h3>
	Muscular atrophy of distal leg muscles.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Distal lower limb muscle atrophy is commonly due to peripheral neuropathy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001300" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Parkinsonism</a></h3>
	Characteristic neurologic anomaly resulting form degeneration of dopamine-generating cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain, characterized clinically by shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement and difficulty with walking and gait.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001336" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Myoclonus</a></h3>
	Very brief, involuntary random muscular contractions occurring at rest, in response to sensory stimuli, or accompanying voluntary movements.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002495" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired vibratory sensation</a></h3>
	A decrease in the ability to perceive vibration. Clinically, this is usually tested with a tuning fork which vibrates at 128 Hz and is applied to bony prominences such as the malleoli at the ankles or the metacarpal-phalangeal joints. There is a slow decay of vibration from the tuning fork. The degree of vibratory sense loss can be crudely estimated by counting the number of seconds that the examiner can perceive the vibration longer than the patient.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Impaired vibratory sensation may suggesti involvement of the posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway, which is responsible for transmitting fine touch, vibration and conscious proprioceptive information from the body to the cerebral cortex.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003474" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sensory impairment</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the primary sensation that is mediated by peripheral nerves (pain, temperature, touch, vibration, joint position). The word hypoesthesia (or hyesthesia) refers to a reduction in cutaneous sensation to a specific type of testing.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term does not include abnormalities of cortical sensation such as two-point discrimination, stereognosis, and graphesthesia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010830" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired tactile sensation</a></h3>
	A reduced sense of touch (tactile sensation). This is usually tested with a wisp of cotton or a fine camel's hair brush, by asking patients to say 'now' each time they feel the stimulus.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010831" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired proprioception</a></h3>
	A loss or impairment of the sensation of the relative position of parts of the body and joint position.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010829" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired temperature sensation</a></h3>
	A reduced ability to discriminate between different temperatures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Temperature sensation can be tested by touching the skin several seconds with a water flask filled to the desired temperature. Persons with normal temperature sensation should at least be able to identify as warm a flask that is 35-36 degrees C and identify as cool a flask at 28-32 degrees C.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007328" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Impaired pain sensation</a></h3>
	Reduced ability to perceive painful stimuli.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012079" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of central motor conduction</a></h3>
	Any anomaly of the conduction of motor nerve impulses in the central nervous system.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Nerve conduction velocity in the central motor pathways of the brain and spinal cord can be studied by methods including transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the cortex, cervical cord, thoracic cord and conus medullaris and determination of motor latencies to various muscles. This measure is thought to represent conduction in large diameter fibres in the corticospinal tracts.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002494" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep</a></h3>
	Abnormality of REM sleep. Phases of REM sleep are characterized by desynchronized EEG patterns, increases in heart rate and blood pressure, sympathetic activation, and a profound loss of muscle tonus except for the eye and middle-ear muscles. There are then phases of rapid eye movements.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006892" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Frontotemporal cerebral atrophy</a></h3>
	Atrophy (wasting, decrease in size of cells or tissue) affecting the frontotemporal cerebrum.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003457" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG abnormality</a></h3>
	Abnormal results of investigations using electromyography (EMG).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003445" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: neuropathic changes</a></h3>
	The presence of characteristic findings of denervation on electromyography (fibrillations, positive sharp waves, and giant motor unit potentials).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This is a bundled term. It is preferable to annotate the precise clinical observations, but the term is kept now for convenience.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002366" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal lower motor neuron morphology</a></h3>
	Any structural anomaly of the lower motor neuron.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007002" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Motor axonal neuropathy</a></h3>
	Progressive impairment of function of motor axons with muscle weakness, atrophy, and cramps. The deficits are length-dependent, meaning that muscles innervated by the longest nerves are affected first, so that for instance the arms are affected at a later age than the onset of deficits involving the lower leg.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Distal motor neuropathy is a bundled term that should not be used if more detailed information about the phenotype is available.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007220" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Demyelinating motor neuropathy</a></h3>
	Demyelination of peripheral motor nerves.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Demyelinating motor neuropathy demonstrates slow motor nerve conduction velocities with reduced amplitudes of motor nerve conduction and prolonged distal latencies.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001272" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebellar atrophy</a></h3>
	Atrophy (wasting) of the cerebellum.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Cerebellar atrophy can be diagnosed if the cerebellum is small with shrunken folia and large cerebellar fissures or if it has been shown to undergo progressive volume loss.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002059" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cerebral atrophy</a></h3>
	Atrophy (wasting, decrease in size of cells or tissue) affecting the cerebrum.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Atrophy may be progressive over time.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002134" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the basal ganglia</a></h3>
	Abnormality of the basal ganglia.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei (striatum, pallidum substantia nigra, and the subthalamic nucleus) at the base of the forebrain that are connected to the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, and other areas. The basal ganglia subserve motor functions that are distinct from those of the pyramidal (corticospinal) tract, for which reason neurologic abnormalities caused by lesions to the basal ganglia are often referred to as extrapyramidal.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cataract</a></h3>
	A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000519" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Congenital cataract</a></h3>
	A congenital cataract.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
In general, congenital cataracts are bilateral and that is the assumption with the terms in this cataract subhierarchy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000496" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of eye movement</a></h3>
	An abnormality in voluntary or involuntary eye movements or their control.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001251" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ataxia</a></h3>
	Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- oder overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Ataxia can be differentiated into dyssynergy, asynergy, dysmetria (hypometria, hypermetria), dysdiadochokinesis, gait ataxia, truncal ataxia, limb ataxia, and dysarthria). Note: This term does not include sensory ataxia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002066" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Gait ataxia</a></h3>
	A type of ataxia characterized by the impairment of the ability to coordinate the movements required for normal walking. Gait ataxia is characteirzed by a wide-based staggering gait with a tendency to fall.

	Functional neurological abnormalities related to dysfunction of the pyramidal tract.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Presence of these signs can indicate affection of the corticospinal (pyramidal) tracts.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001332" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dystonia</a></h3>
	An abnormally increased muscular tone that causes fixed abnormal postures. There is a slow, intermittent twisting motion that leads to exaggerated turning and posture of the extremities and trunk.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007067" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Distal peripheral sensory neuropathy</a></h3>
	Peripheral sensory neuropathy affecting primarily distal sensation.
