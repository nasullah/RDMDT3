<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Moderate to Severe/ Profound ID disproportionate to parental IQ unless the family history is consistent with an X-linked disorder<br />
- Congenital onset<br />
- Developmental Delay <br />
- +/- clinical features suggestive of a specific syndrome <br />
- Metabolic causes have been excluded

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Antenatal history suggestive of non-genetic cause<br />
- Proven congenital or neonatal infections<br />
- Known genetic cause already identified <br />
- Microarray analysis abnormal and clearly pathogenic

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
- For syndromes where the cause of disease is 1-2 genes these need to be excluded before Genomics England recruitment, e.g. for Kabuki syndrome, MLL2 (KMT2D) and KDM6A should have been tested

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

						<!-- <h2>Intellectual Disability Phenotypes</h2> -->

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
	A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010862" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Delayed fine motor development</a></h3>
	A type of motor delay characterized by an delay in acquiring the ability to control the fingers and hands.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002194" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Delayed gross motor development</a></h3>
	A type of motor delay characterized by an delay in acquiring the ability to control the large muscles of the body for walking, running, sitting, and crawling.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000750" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Delayed speech and language development</a></h3>
	A degree of language development that is significantly below the norm for a child of a specified age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Language delay can be characterized by a failure to meet the developmental milestones for language development, an inability to follow directions, or slow or incomprehensible speech after the age of three years, as well as with severe problems with syntax or articulation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000729" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Autistic behavior</a></h3>
	A disorder beginning in childhood. It is marked by the presence of markedly abnormal or impaired development in social interaction and communication and a markedly restricted repertoire of activity and interest. Manifestations of the disorder vary greatly depending on the developmental level and chronological age of the individual (DSM-IV).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term can be used to refer to autism spectrum disorder as a phenotypic feature that can be a component of a disease. Autism spectrum disorder range from a severe form, called autistic disorder, to a milder form, Asperger syndrome.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001508" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Failure to thrive</a></h3>
	Failure to thrive (FTT) refers to a child whose physical growth is substantially below the norm.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Although there is no clear consensus on the exact definition of FTT, it is usually diagnoses in a child growing below the 3rd percentile or in a child whose decreased growth has cross two major growth percentiles (for example, from above the 75th percentile to below the 25th percentile).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000953" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperpigmentation of the skin</a></h3>
	A darkening of the skin related to an increase in melanin production and deposition.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001010" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypopigmentation of the skin</a></h3>
	A reduction of skin color related to a decrease in melanin production and deposition.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011276" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Vascular skin abnormality</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000478" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the eye</a></h3>
	Any abnormality of the eye, including location, spacing, and intraocular abnormalities.

	An abnormality of the gastrointestinal tract.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002011" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Morphological abnormality of the central nervous system</a></h3>
	A structural abnormality of the central nervous system.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001290" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Generalized hypotonia</a></h3>
	Generalized muscular hypotonia (abnormally low muscle tone).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001257" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Spasticity</a></h3>
	A motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes with increased muscle tone, exaggerated (hyperexcitable) tendon reflexes.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002072" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Chorea</a></h3>
	Chorea (Greek for 'dance') refers to widespread arrhythmic involuntary movements of a forcible, jerky and restless fashion.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001251" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ataxia</a></h3>
	Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- oder overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Ataxia can be differentiated into dyssynergy, asynergy, dysmetria (hypometria, hypermetria), dysdiadochokinesis, gait ataxia, truncal ataxia, limb ataxia, and dysarthria). Note: This term does not include sensory ataxia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001332" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dystonia</a></h3>
	An abnormally increased muscular tone that causes fixed abnormal postures. There is a slow, intermittent twisting motion that leads to exaggerated turning and posture of the extremities and trunk.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001197" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of prenatal development or birth</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the fetus or the birth of the fetus, excluding structural abnormalities.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Because of the close link between prenatal developmental abnormalities and abnormalities of the birth process, a single term is chosen to subsume both classes of abnormality.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001561" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Polyhydramnios</a></h3>
	The presence of excess amniotic fluid in the uterus during pregnancy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Polyhydramnios is diagnosed if the deepest vertical pool of amniotic fluid is more than 8 cm or amniotic fluid index is more than 95th percentile for the corresponding gestational age.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001562" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Oligohydramnios</a></h3>
	Diminished amniotic fluid volume in pregnancy.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Oligohydramnios is the opposite of polyhydramnios. In normal pregnancy the amniotic fluid volume increases by about 10 ml/day until the 34th, after which it slowly diminishes. A normal amniotic fluid volume at term is about 500-2,000 ml. Oligohydramnios is defined as an AFI (amniotic fluid index) less than 5 cm or smallest vertical pocket of fluid less than 2 cm.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010880" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Increased nuchal translucency</a></h3>
	The presence of an abnormally large hypoechoic space in the posterior fetal neck (usually detected on prenatal ultrasound examination).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Increased nuchal translucency may be related to a cystic hygroma or to mesenchymal edema. Increased nuchal translucency can be classified into three categories: 1) cardiac abnormalities, combined with abnormal ductus venosus flow velocities, is found, leading to the theory that cardiac failure causes nuchal translucency enlargement; 2) various types of abnormalities are found in the extracellular matrix of the nuchal skin of fetuses with increased nuchal translucency; 3) abnormal lymphatic development is demonstrated in fetuses with increased nuchal translucency.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009800" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Maternal diabetes</a></h3>
	Maternal diabetes can either be a gestational, mostly type 2 diabetes, or a type 1 diabetes. Essential is the resulting maternal hyperglycemia as a non-specific teratogen, imposing the same risk of congenital malformations to pregnant women with both type 1 and type2 diabetes.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008071" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Maternal hypertension</a></h3>
	Increased blood pressure during a pregnancy.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002540" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Inability to walk</a></h3>
	Incapability to ambulate.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003498" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Disproportionate short stature</a></h3>
	A kind of short stature in which different regions of the body are shortened to differing extents.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003508" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Proportionate short stature</a></h3>
	A kind of short stature in which different regions of the body are shortened to a comparable extent.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001520" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Large for gestational age</a></h3>
	The term large for gestational age applies to babies whose birth weight lies above the 90th percentile for that gestational age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Fetal macrosomia has been defined in several different ways, including birth weight of 4000-4500 g (8 lb 13 oz to 9 lb 15 oz) or greater than 90% for gestational age after correcting for neonatal sex and ethnicity. Based on these definitions, macrosomia affects 1-10% of all pregnancies. A diagnosis of fetal macrosomia can be made only by measuring birth weight after delivery; therefore, the condition is confirmed only retrospectively, ie, after delivery of the neonate.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000098" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Tall stature</a></h3>
	A height above that which is expected according to age and gender norms.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000256" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Macrocephaly</a></h3>
	Occipitofrontal (head) circumference greater than 97th centile compared to appropriate, age matched, sex-matched normal standards. Alternatively, a apparently increased size of the cranium.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far above the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Macrocephaly is an absolute term. The term relative macrocephaly can be used when the head size centile exceeds the centile for height, for example, head size at the 75th centile with height at the 5th centile for age and sex.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
	Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.<br />

The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.
