						<!-- <h2>Kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
Presumed Kyphoscoliotic Ehlers Danlos Syndrome with no genetic diagnosis with two or more of the following features:<br />
•	Significant Joint hypermobility and dislocations<br />
•	Skin fragility and hyperextensibility<br />
•	Kyphoscoliosis<br />
•	Increased length at birth with wrist drop<br />
•	Muscular hypotonia<br />
•	Criss-cross lines on palm and soles<br />
•	Hearing impairment<br />
•	Ocular fragility

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
•	Known genetic aetiology<br />
•	Kyphoscoliosis as part of an underlying genetic / syndromal diagnosis<br />
•	Symptomatic joint hypermobility without additional confirmed diagnostic features such as kyphoscoliosis

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
<br />
- PLOD1<br />
- If seen in Specialist EDS Centres (London/ Sheffield): Kyphoscoliotic targeted gene panel

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

<br />
Comment:<br />
Skin hyperelasticity is to be distinguished from cutis laxa, which refers to extra, redundant skin which tends to hang in folds.

	Muscular hypotonia is an abnormally low muscle tone (the amount of tension or resistance to movement in a muscle), often involving reduced muscle strength. Hypotonia is characterized by a diminished resistance to passive stretching.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001382" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Joint hypermobility</a></h3>
	The ability of a joint to move beyond its normal range of motion.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001608" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the voice</a></h3>
	Any abnormality of the voice.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term describes any abnormality of the voice, i.e., of the sounds produced by humans by the passage of air through the larynx and over the vocal cords, and then modified by the resonance organs, the nasopharynx, and the mouth.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000501" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Glaucoma</a></h3>
	Glaucoma refers loss of retinal ganglion cells in a characteristic pattern of optic neuropathy usually associated with increased intraocular pressure.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The feature that differentiates glaucoma from other causes of visual morbidity is a characteristic pattern of damage to the optic nerve head. This is most easily recognised at the superior and inferior poles of the optic disc. The vertical cup:disc ratio (VCDR) has proved to be a simple, relatively robust index of glaucomatous loss of the neuroretinal rim. As with intraocular pressure, VCDR is a continuous variable within the population.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010727" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Spontaneous rupture of the globe</a></h3>
	Rupture of the eyeball not due to trauma.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004322" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short stature</a></h3>
	A height below that which is expected according to age and gender norms. Although there is no universally accepted definition of short stature, many refer to "short stature" as height more than 2 standard deviations below the mean for age and gender (or below the 3rd percentile for age and gender dependent norms).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000098" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Tall stature</a></h3>
	A height above that which is expected according to age and gender norms.

	Abnormally long and slender fingers ("spider fingers").
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001371" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Flexion contracture</a></h3>
	A flexion contracture is a bent (flexed) joint that cannot be straightened actively or passively. It is thus a chronic loss of joint motion due to structural changes in muscle, tendons, ligaments, or skin that prevents normal movement of joints.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002659" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Increased susceptibility to fractures</a></h3>
	An abnormally increased tendency to fractures of bones caused by an abnormal reduction in bone strength that is generally associated with an increased risk of fracture.<br />
<br />

This is a bundled term that will be made obsolete.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001373" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Joint dislocation</a></h3>

<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that the cornea's diameter is normally about 9.5-10.0 mm at birth and reaches 10.0-12-5 mm in adulthood.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000938" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Osteopenia</a></h3>
	Osteopenia refers to a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) below normal peak BMD but not low enough to be classified as osteoporosis. According to the WHO, osteopenia is characterized by a value of BMD more than 1 standard deviation below the young adult mean, but less than 2 standard deviations below this value.

	An anomaly of the sternum, also known as the breastbone.
