  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Recurrent seizures with onset of epilepsy prior to two years of age AND
- Negative genome wide microarray copy number analysis</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Major structural brain malformation such as cortical malformation, neuronal migration defect AND/OR
- Known clear biochemical, enzymatic or molecular genetic evidence of underlying metabolic cause, e.g. organic aciduria, vitamin B6 metabolism defect</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.

Comment:
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002197" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Generalized seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Seizures of with initial involvement of both cerebral hemispheres.

Comment:
Generalized seizures are sub-categorized into several major types: generalized tonic clonic; myoclonic; absence; and atonic.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007359" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Focal seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Seizures of which initial semiology indicates, or is consistent with, initial activation of only part of one cerebral hemisphere.

Comment:
Partial seizures can be classified as simple (consciousness is maintained) or complex (consciousness is impaired or lost).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011097" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Epileptic spasms</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A sudden flexion, extension or mixed extension-flexion of predominantly proximal and truncal muscles which is usually more sustained than a myoclonic movement but not as sustained as a tonic seizure.

Comment:
The maximum age of onset is between 3 and 12 months, the peak being at 6 months. However, spasms may start from birth, or appear long after the age of 12 months, including into adulthood. Infantile spasms represent a specific type of seizure seen in an epilepsy syndrome of infancy and childhood known as West Syndrome. West Syndrome is characterized by infantile spasms, developmental regression, and hypsarrhythmia (as demonstrated by electroencephalography).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012469" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Infantile spasms</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Infantile spasms represent a subset of &quot;epileptic spasms&quot;. Infantile Spasms are epileptic spasms starting in the first year of life (infancy).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003739" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Myoclonic spasms</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002121" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Absence seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Recurrent absence seizures are generalized seizures and are characterized by a loss of consciousness, thus, are a form of dialeptic seizures.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002373" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Febrile seizures</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Febrile seizures are convulsions induced by a fever in infants or small children and are generally characterized by loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic movements. Most febrile seizures last a minute or two.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002353" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EEG abnormality</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormality observed by electroencephalogram (EEG), which is used to record of the brain&#39;s spontaneous electrical activity from multiple electrodes placed on the scalp.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002521" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypsarrhythmia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Hypsarrhythmia is abnormal interictal high amplitude waves and a background of irregular spikes. There is continuous (during wakefulness), high-amplitude (&gt;200 Hz), generalized polymorphic slowing with no organized background and multifocal spikes demonstrated by electroencephalography (EEG).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010851" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EEG with burst suppression</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The burst suppression pattern in electroencephalography refers to a characteristic periodic pattern of low voltage (&lt;10 microvolts) suppressed background and a relatively shorter pattern of higher amplitude slow, sharp, and spiking complexes.

Comment:
Burst suppression can occur in a generalized or lateralized distribution and is often a sign of severe encephalopathy. Generally, an interburst interval of 30 seconds or less is associated with a better prognosis than longer interburst intervals (&gt;30 sec).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011198" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EEG with generalized epileptiform discharges</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">EEG discharges recorded on the entire scalp typically seen in persons with epilepsy.

Comment:
Spikes (&lt;70 ms) and sharp waves (70-200 ms) are sharp transient waves that have a strong association with epilepsy. No difference is noted in terms of clinical significance of spikes and sharp waves. Significant spikes usually are followed by a slow wave.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011185" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EEG with focal epileptiform discharges</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">EEG discharges recorded in particular areas of the A localized (focal) abnormality in cerebral electrical activity recorded along the scalp by electroencephalography (EEG).

Comment:
Note that a focal EEG abnormality is not synonymous with &quot;focal epileptiform discharges&quot; because a focal EEG abnormality is not necessarily epileptiform (e.g., it could be a focal slowing).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010841" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Multifocal epileptiform discharges</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A abnormality in cerebral electrical activity recorded along the scalp by electroencephalography (EEG) and being identified at multiple locations (foci).</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001256" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability, mild</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Mild intellectual disability is defined as an intelligence quotient (IQ) in the range of 50-69.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002342" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability, moderate</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Moderate mental retardation is defined as an intelligence quotient (IQ) in the range of 35-49.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010864" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability, severe</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Severe mental retardation is defined as an intelligence quotient (IQ) in the range of 20-34.
