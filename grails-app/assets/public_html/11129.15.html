  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 - COL2A1, COL11A1</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000618" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Blindness</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Blindness is the condition of lacking visual perception due to physiological or neurological factors.

Comment:
Various scales have been developed to describe the extent of vision loss and define blindness. Total blindness is the complete lack of form and visual light perception and is clinically recorded as NLP (no light perception). Blindness is frequently used to describe severe visual impairment with residual vision. Those described as having only light perception have no more sight than the ability to tell light from dark and the general direction of a light source.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000501" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Glaucoma</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Glaucoma refers loss of retinal ganglion cells in a characteristic pattern of optic neuropathy usually associated with increased intraocular pressure.

Comment:
The feature that differentiates glaucoma from other causes of visual morbidity is a characteristic pattern of damage to the optic nerve head. This is most easily recognised at the superior and inferior poles of the optic disc. The vertical cup:disc ratio (VCDR) has proved to be a simple, relatively robust index of glaucomatous loss of the neuroretinal rim. As with intraocular pressure, VCDR is a continuous variable within the population.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cataract</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.

Comment:
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000598" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the ear</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of the ear.

Comment:
Either a morphological abnormality or hearing deficit. This should be split more cleanly in the future.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.

Comment:
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000405" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Conductive hearing impairment</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of vibrational conductance of sound to the inner ear leading to impairment of sensory perception of sound.

Comment:
A conductive hearing impariment with greater than 90 dB loss.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000407" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sensorineural hearing impairment</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A type of hearing impairment  in one or both ears related to an abnormal functionality of the cochlear nerve.

Comment:
Hearing loss caused by damage or dysfunction of the auditory nerve (cranial nerve VIII, also known as the cochlear nerve).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003196" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short nose</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Distance from nasion to subnasale more than two standard deviations below the mean, or alternatively, an apparently decreased length from the nasal root to the nasal tip.

Comment:
Note: a small nose has both decreased height and a decreased width. These should be coded separately.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011800" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Midface retrusion</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Posterior positions and/or vertical shortening of the infraorbital and perialar regions, or increased concavity of the face and/or reduced nasolabial angle.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000272" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Malar flattening</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Underdevelopment of the malar (frontal) process of the maxilla, appreciated in profile and/or by palpation.

Comment:
The malar process is the most medial and superior portion of the maxilla, contiguous with the lateral boundary of the nasal bridge. The term malar hypoplasia is no longer preferred because surface examination cannot distinguish hypoplasia from hypotrophy.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005280" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Depressed nasal bridge</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Posterior positioning of the nasal root in relation to the overall facial profile for age.

Comment:
The adjective &quot;depressed&quot; here does not indicate an active process but a status. A depressed nasal bridge can occur irrespective of the width of the nasal bridge, and the width should be assessed independently. In infancy, the nasal bridge is relatively more posterior than in the older person. The term depressed nasal bridge should only be used when the bridge is more posterior than is typical for age and ethnic background.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000463" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anteverted nares</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Anteriorly-facing nostrils viewed with the head in the Frankfurt horizontal and the eyes of the observer level with the eyes of the subject. This gives the appearance of an upturned nose (upturned nasal tip).

Comment:
The tip of the nose is upturned and is positioned superiorly to the nasal base, allowing the nares to be easily visualized from the front. With maturation and growth of the nasal ridge and tip, the nares usually become more downwardly directed.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000201" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Pierre-Robin sequence</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Pierre Robin malformation is a sequence of developmental malformations characterized by micrognathia (mandibular hypoplasia), glossoptosis and cleft palate.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000347" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Micrognathia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Developmental hypoplasia of the mandible.

Comment:
Mandibular hypoplasia, also known as micrognathia, is a term that describes an abnormally small lower jaw.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000175" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft palate</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Cleft palate is a developmental defect of the palate resulting from a failure of fusion of the palatine processes and manifesting as a separation of the roof of the mouth (soft and hard palate).

Comment:
Cleft palate is a developmental defect that occurs between the 7th and 12th week of pregnancy. Normally, the palatine processes fuse during this time to form the soft and hard palate. A failure of fusion results in a cleft palate. The clinical spectrum ranges from bifid uvula, to (incomplete or complete) cleft of the soft palate, up to (complete or incomplete) cleft of both the soft and hard palate.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000193" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Bifid uvula</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Uvula separated into two parts most easily seen at the tip.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000158" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Macroglossia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Increased length and width of the tongue.

Comment:
Normal standards do not exist. Large size usually leads to protrusion of the tongue. This is an acknowledged bundled term, but due to its frequent usage and relative paucity of situations that would call for separate individual assessments of tongue dimensions, the bundled term is retained. Micrognathia may give the false appearance of a large tongue.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001634" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Mitral valve prolapse</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">One or both of the leaflets (cusps) of the mitral valve bulges back into the left atrium upon contraction of the left ventricle.

Comment:
Mitral valve prolapse can be associated with mitral regurgitation.</p>
