<br />
Comment:<br />
Increased muscle bulk based on clinical observation.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011805" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of muscle morphology</a></h3>
	A structural abnormality of a skeletal muscle.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007210" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Lower limb amyotrophy</a></h3>
	Muscular atrophy affecting the lower limb.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009129" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Upper limb amyotrophy</a></h3>
	Muscular atrophy involving the muscles of the upper limbs.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003323" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Progressive muscle weakness</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003690" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Limb muscle weakness</a></h3>
	Reduced strength and weakness of the muscles of the arms and legs.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003327" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Axial muscle weakness</a></h3>
	Reduced strength of the axial musculature (i.e., of the muscles of the head and neck, spine, and ribs).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003473" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Fatigable weakness</a></h3>
	A type of weakness that occurs after a muscle group is used and lessens if the muscle group has some rest. That is, there is diminution of strength with repetitive muscle actions.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This type of weakness is pathognomonic for an abnormality of the neuromuscular junction such as myasthenia gravis. A characteristic form of muscular weakness that worsens after use of affected muscles. Myasthenia is caused by  failure of neuromuscular transmission, which results from the binding of autoantibodies to proteins involved in signaling at the neuromuscular junction, including especially the nicotinic acetyl choline receptor (AChR) or, less frequently, a muscle-specific tyrosine kinase involved in AChR clustering.

	The upper eyelid margin is positioned 3 mm or more lower than usual and covers the superior portion of the iris (objective); or, the upper lid margin obscures at least part of the pupil (subjective).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000518" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cataract</a></h3>
	A cataract is an opacity or clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its capsule.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that some ophthalmologists call any opacity in the lens a cataract, while others restrict the term to lens opacities that impair vision. We use the term to refer to the first meaning (any lens opacity).

	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001371" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Flexion contracture</a></h3>
	A flexion contracture is a bent (flexed) joint that cannot be straightened actively or passively. It is thus a chronic loss of joint motion due to structural changes in muscle, tendons, ligaments, or skin that prevents normal movement of joints.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003691" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Scapular winging</a></h3>
	Abnormal protrusion of the scapula away from the surface of the back.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002650" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Scoliosis</a></h3>
	The presence of an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003306" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Spinal rigidity</a></h3>
	Reduced ability to move the vertebral column with a resulting limitation of neck and trunk flexion.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002652" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Skeletal dysplasia</a></h3>
	A general term describing features characterized by abnormal development of bones and connective tissues.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The word skeletal dysplasia is most often used to describe a group of over 380 inherited conditions that involve abnormal development of bones and connective tissues. However, the word can also be used to describe the presence of a congenital defects of bones or connective tissues that are found in one or more of the diseases, especially on prenatal ultrasound, i.e., a situation in which it is often not yet possible to make an exact etiological diagnosis. This is the sense of the phrase we use in the HPO. It is, however, preferable to annotate the observed abnormalities.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003474" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sensory impairment</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the primary sensation that is mediated by peripheral nerves (pain, temperature, touch, vibration, joint position). The word hypoesthesia (or hyesthesia) refers to a reduction in cutaneous sensation to a specific type of testing.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term does not include abnormalities of cortical sensation such as two-point discrimination, stereognosis, and graphesthesia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011675" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Arrhythmia</a></h3>
	Any cardiac rhythm other than the normal sinus rhythm. Such a rhythm may be either of sinus or ectopic origin and either regular or irregular. An arrhythmia may be due to a disturbance in impulse formation or conduction or both.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001638" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cardiomyopathy</a></h3>
	A myocardial disorder in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal, in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease and congenital heart disease sufficient to cause the observed myocardial abnormality.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000819" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Diabetes mellitus</a></h3>
	A group of abnormalities characterized by hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002060" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the cerebrum</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the telencephalon, which is also known as the cerebrum.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001317" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the cerebellum</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the cerebellum.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010546" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Muscle fibrillation</a></h3>
	Fine, rapid twitching of individual muscle fibers with little or no movement of the muscle as a whole. If a motor neuron or its axon is destroyed, the muscle fibers it innervates undergo denervation atrophy. This leads to hypersensitivity of individual muscle fibers to acetyl choline so that they may contract spontaneously. Isolated activity of individual muscle fibers is generally so fine it cannot be seen through the intact skin, although it can be recorded as a short-duration spike in the EMG.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030112" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal muscle fiber alpha dystroglycan</a></h3>
	A deviation from normal of muscle alpha-dystroglcan expression. Alpha-dystroglycan is a heavily glycosylated peripheral-membrane component of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DAPC), which, in addition to laminin alpha2, binds perlecan and agrin in the extracellular matrix, whereas beta-dystroglycan, derived from the same gene, is a transmembrane protein that links to dystrophin intracellularly.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030119" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal muscle fiber calpain-3</a></h3>
	A deviation from normal in the amount of calpain-3 in muscle tissue. Calpains are intracellular nonlysosomal cysteine proteases modulated by calcium ions. A typical calpain is a heterodimer composed of two distinct subunits, one large (over 80 kDa) and the other small (30 kDa). While only one gene encoding the small subunit has been demonstrated, there are many genes for the large one. CAPN3 is similar to ubiquitous Calpain 1 and 2 (m-calpain and micro-calpain), but contains specific insertion sequences (NS, IS1 and IS2). Calpains cleave target proteins to modify their properties, rather than breaking down the substrates.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030113" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal muscle fiber dysferlin</a></h3>
	A deviation from normal in the expression of dysferlin in muscle tissue. Dysferlin is an ubiquitous 230-KDa transmembrane protein involved in calcium-mediated sarcolemma resealing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030090" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal muscle fiber merosin expression</a></h3>
	An anomalous amount of merosin in muscle fibers. Merosin is a basement membrane-associated protein found in placenta, striated muscle, and peripheral nerve.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030098" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Reduced muscle dystrophin expression</a></h3>
	A decreased amount of dystrophin in muscle fiber tissue.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030116" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal muscle fiber emerin</a></h3>
	A deviation from normal of the amount of the inner nuclear membrane protein emerin in muscle tissue.
