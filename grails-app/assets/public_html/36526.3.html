  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Evidence of diffuse or focal cortical brain malformation on brain MRI or pathology, AND
•	MCD the cardinal feature, AND
•	Appropriate known gene, if testing available via UKGTN, excluded , AND
•	Congenital infection, especially CMV, has been excluded if suggested by phenotype</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Brain MRI or pathology not available
•	Known genetic cause
•	Evidence of congenital infection
•	Known metabolic condition
•	Raised CK levels indicative of muscle-eye-brain disease
•	Diagnosis of Tuberous Sclerosis
•	MCD clearly part of a known MCA syndrome with a known cause
•	Fetal cases – these should be recruited to the fetal structural brain anomaly category</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 -	1. Microarray
-	2. Exclusion of PAFAH1B1 and DCX gene deletions using MLPA or similar method where appropriate.
-	3. Single MCD gene or MCD gene panel testing as guided by phenotype.</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Gray matter heterotopia is a neurological disorder caused by clumps of grey matter being located in the wrong part of the brain. It is characterized as a type of cortical malformation. The neurons in heterotopia may appear to be normal, except for their mislocation; nuclear studies have shown glucose metabolism equal to that of normally positioned gray matter. The condition causes a variety of symptoms, but usually includes some degree of epilepsy or recurring seizures, and often affects the brain&#39;s ability to function on higher levels. Symptoms range from nonexistent to profound, in which case heterotopia can result in severe seizure disorder, loss of motor skills, and mental retardation.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007165" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Periventricular gray matter heterotopia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A form of gray matter heterotopia were the mislocalized gray matter is typically located periventricularly, also sometimes called subependymal heterotopia. Periventricular means beside the ventricles. This is by far the most common location for heterotopia. Subependymal heterotopia present in a wide array of variations. There can be a small single node or a large number of nodes, can exist on either or both sides of the brain at any point along the higher ventricle margins, can be small or large, single or multiple, and can form a small node or a large wavy or curved mass.

Comment:
Periventricular gray matter heterotopia can be seen for example in patients with Smith-Lemli-Opitz-Syndrome.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.

Comment:
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000238" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hydrocephalus</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Hydrocephalus is an active distension of the ventricular system of the brain resulting from inadequate passage of CSF from its point of production within the cerebral ventricles to its point of absorption into the systemic circulation.

Comment:
Hydrocephalus results from an imbalance between the rate of production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), mainly in the choroid plexus, and its reabsorption in the subarchnoid space over brain and spinal cord.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001334" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Communicating hydrocephalus</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A form of hydrocephalus in which there is no visible obstruction to the flow of the cerebrospinal fluid between the ventricles and subarachnoid space.

Comment:
Communicating hydrocephalus may be caused by overproduction of CSF, defective absorption of CSF (the most common cause) or venous drainage insufficiency.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010953" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Noncommunicating hydrocephalus</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A form of hydrocephalus in which the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the cerebral ventricular system or in the outlets of the CSF to the arachnoid space is obstructed.

Comment:
The most common form of noncommunicating hydrocephalus is obstructive and is caused by intraventricular or extraventricular mass-occupying lesions that disrupt the ventricular anatomy.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormality of the basal ganglia.

Comment:
The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei (striatum, pallidum substantia nigra, and the subthalamic nucleus) at the base of the forebrain that are connected to the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, and other areas. The basal ganglia subserve motor functions that are distinct from those of the pyramidal (corticospinal) tract, for which reason neurologic abnormalities caused by lesions to the basal ganglia are often referred to as extrapyramidal.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Underdevelopment of the cerebellum.

Comment:
By prenatal ultrasound, cerebellar hypoplasia is diagnosed if the cerebellum measures more than two standard deviations below the mean. In adults, cerebellar hypoplasia is typically diagnosed by computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebellar hypoplasia can be diagnosed if there is a small cerebellum with fissures of normal size compared with the folia (this is a distinguishing characteristic compared with cerebellar atrophy).</p>
