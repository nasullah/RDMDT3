						<!-- <h2>Undiagnosed neurocutaneous disorders eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
All of the following:<br />
1)	Abnormal skin pigmentation (café au lait pigmentation, or hypopigmentation, or both)<br />
2)	Affected individual has a family history of abnormal skin pigmentation in a first degree relative or is the offspring of a consanguineous relationship<br />
3)	Neurological phenotype in at least two of the family members who have skin pigmentary abnormalities (seizures or developmental delay or evidence of congenital abnormality on MRI scan)<br />
4)	No diagnosis after assessment by Dermatologist, Neurologist and Geneticist<br />
5)	No evidence of chromosomal abnormality on karyotype<br />
6)	No pathogenic mutations in the NF1 gene if the child is too young to definitely exclude neurofibromatosis type 1 clinically, and the phenotype could potentially be compatible with that diagnosis

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>


<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
 NF1 as indicated above

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001000" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of skin pigmentation</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the pigmentation of the skin.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000957" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cafe-au-lait spot</a></h3>
	Cafe-au-lait spots are hyperpigmented lesions that can vary in color from light brown to dark brown with smooth borders and having a size of 1.5 cm or more in adults and 0.5 cm or more in children.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The phrase cafe-au-lait comes from the French word for milk-coffee. A single cafe-au-lait spot can be an isolated finding in otherwise normal individuals. Multiple cafe-au-lait spots often indicate the presence of neurofibromatosis type 1 but may also be seen in other diseases including McCune-Albright syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Fanconi anemia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001010" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypopigmentation of the skin</a></h3>
	A reduction of skin color related to a decrease in melanin production and deposition.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001480" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Freckling</a></h3>
	The presence of an increased number of freckles, small circular spots on the skin that are darker than the surrounding skin because of deposits of melanin.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009887" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of hair pigmentation</a></h3>
	An abnormality of hair pigmentation (color).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001250" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Seizures</a></h3>
	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
	A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002650" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Scoliosis</a></h3>
	The presence of an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000924" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the skeletal system</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the skeletal system.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000818" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the endocrine system</a></h3>
	Ab abnormality of the endocrine system.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The endocrine system is composed of glands that secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream and includes the following glands: thyroid, parathyroids, adrenals, pancreas, gonads (testicles and ovaries), and pituitary. Many other organs, such as the kidney, liver, and heart, have secondary endocrine functions.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001627" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of cardiac morphology</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the heart.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001999" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal facial shape</a></h3>
	An abnormal morphology (form) of the face or its components.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term now covers many of the historical inexact descriptions such as Bird-like facies that probably should be avoided in modern genetics. This portion of the Ontology should be revised.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002060" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the cerebrum</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the telencephalon, which is also known as the cerebrum.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001317" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the cerebellum</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the cerebellum.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000478" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the eye</a></h3>
	Any abnormality of the eye, including location, spacing, and intraocular abnormalities.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012210" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal renal morphology</a></h3>
	Any structural anomaly of the kidney.
