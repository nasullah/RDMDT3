<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
- Progressive cognitive deterioration with change in memory, vision, behaviour or language with functional impairment  <br />
- Age at onset <50 years OR <br />
- Later onset with family history of dementia of the same type in a first or second degree relative  <br />
<br />
Individuals with severe or syndromic disease should be recruited according to standard guidance, typically as trios. Disease status of apparently unaffected participants should be determined according to standard clinical practice to detect cryptic disease.  In other cases, unaffected individuals should not be recruited. Recruitment in such families should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs.

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
- Identified underlying cause, e.g. structural brain lesion. NB in uncertain cases with anxiety/depression brain atrophy on imaging, CSF findings or EEG abnormalities should be available to support the diagnosis of a primary degenerative syndrome

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:<br />
- Clinical syndrome Alzheimer disease: PSEN1, APP <br />
- Clinical syndrome FTLD: MAPT, C9ORF72, GRN  <br />
- Clinical syndrome Prion disease: PRNP

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

						<!-- <h2>Fronto-temporal dementia phenotypes</h2> -->

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000726" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dementia</a></h3>
	A loss of global cognitive ability of sufficient amount to interfere with normal social or occupational function. Dementia represents a loss of previously present cognitive abilities, generally in adults, and can affect memory, thinking, language, judgment, and behavior.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002145" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Frontotemporal dementia</a></h3>
	A dementia associated with degeneration of the frontotemporal lobe and clinically associated with personality and behavioral changes such as disinhibition, apathy, and lack of insight. The hallmark feature of frontotemporal dementia is the presentation with focal syndromes such as progressive language dysfunction, or aphasia, or behavioral changes characteristic of frontal lobe disorders.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000708" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Behavioral abnormality</a></h3>
	An abnormality of mental functioning including various affective, behavioural, cognitive and perceptual abnormalities.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007064" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Progressive language deterioration</a></h3>
	Progressive loss of previously present language abilities.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002381" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Aphasia</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007153" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Progressive extrapyramidal movement disorder</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001300" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Parkinsonism</a></h3>
	Characteristic neurologic anomaly resulting form degeneration of dopamine-generating cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain, characterized clinically by shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement and difficulty with walking and gait.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007354" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002483" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Bulbar signs</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002167" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neurological speech impairment</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002015" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dysphagia</a></h3>
	Difficulty in swallowing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000478" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the eye</a></h3>
	Any abnormality of the eye, including location, spacing, and intraocular abnormalities.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000597" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ophthalmoparesis</a></h3>
	Ophthalmoplegia is a paralysis or weakness of one or more of the muscles that control eye movement.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000570" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of saccadic eye movements</a></h3>
	An abnormality of eye movement characterized by impairment of fast (saccadic) eye movements.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Fast (saccadic) eye movements comprise voluntary or involuntary refixation movements, the fast phase of vestibular nystagmus, optokinetic nystagmus, and microsaccades.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000514" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Slow saccadic eye movements</a></h3>
	An abnormally slow velocity of the saccadic eye movements.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Saccades are rapid eye movements that align the fovea with the target.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000641" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dysmetric saccades</a></h3>
	The controller signal for saccadic eye movements has two components: the pulse that moves the eye rapidly from one point to the next, and the step that holds the eye in the new position. When both the pulse and the step are not the correct size, a dysmetric refixation eye movement results.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003457" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG abnormality</a></h3>
	Abnormal results of investigations using electromyography (EMG).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003445" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG: neuropathic changes</a></h3>
	The presence of characteristic findings of denervation on electromyography (fibrillations, positive sharp waves, and giant motor unit potentials).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This is a bundled term. It is preferable to annotate the precise clinical observations, but the term is kept now for convenience.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006892" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Frontotemporal cerebral atrophy</a></h3>
	Atrophy (wasting, decrease in size of cells or tissue) affecting the frontotemporal cerebrum.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002134" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the basal ganglia</a></h3>
	Abnormality of the basal ganglia.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei (striatum, pallidum substantia nigra, and the subthalamic nucleus) at the base of the forebrain that are connected to the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, and other areas. The basal ganglia subserve motor functions that are distinct from those of the pyramidal (corticospinal) tract, for which reason neurologic abnormalities caused by lesions to the basal ganglia are often referred to as extrapyramidal.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002366" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal lower motor neuron morphology</a></h3>
	Any structural anomaly of the lower motor neuron.
