  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Patients with inherited skin fragility and a clinical diagnosis of EB of unknown cause
•	Diagnosis confirmed by a consultant dermatologist</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Non-EB genetic causes including porphyria or photosensitivity syndromes
•	Acquired causes including EB acquisita and bullous drug reactions</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 KRT5, KRT14, PLEC, DSP, PKP1, JUP, TGM5, EXPH5, ITGA3, ITGA6, ITGB4, DST, COL17A1, LAMA3, LAMA3A, LAMB3, LAMC2, COL7A1</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

Comment:
Anemia is not a specific entity but can result from many underlying pathologic processes. The three main causes of anemia are blood loss, decreased or faulty red blood cell production, and increased destruction of red blood cells. Various classifications are in clinical use including a classification according to the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the erythrocytes: microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic. Anemias can also be classified according to variations in cell size and shape, as reflected by the red-cell distribution width (RDW). Additionally, anemias can be classified into those of inadequate production and hemolytic anemias.</p>

Comment:
A basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer which rarely metastasizes, but is still considered malignant because it can cause significant destruction and disfigurement by invading surrounding tissues. In 80 percent of all cases, basal cell cancers are found on the head and neck or on other sun-exposed areas of the body. Apart from sporadic basal cell carcinoma, there are hereditary conditions such as the basal cell nevus syndrome where patients develop multiple basal cell carcinomas throughout life.</p>
