  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">A.	All 4 core features of Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) present and no cause found
B.	3 or more features present and family history of SRS or other imprinting disorder; or recurrent fetal loss with IUGR
C.	3 or more features present and multilocus imprinting defect
D.	Isolated/single locus 11p15 methylation defect (H19 loss of methylation) with a family history of Silver-Russell syndrome.

Recruitment of relatives in these families should follow standard guidance.

OR

E.	Isolated/single locus 11p15 methylation defect (H19 loss of methylation) without a family history of Silver-Russell syndrome.

Recruitment to families in group D should occur only as proband-mother-father trios.
Core clinical features of Silver-Russell syndrome:
1.	small for gestational age (birth weight and/or length &lt;-2SDS) +- history of intrauterine growth retardation; 
2.	post-natal short stature (&lt;-2 SDS )
3.	body asymmetry
4.	marked feeding difficulties in infancy / childhood +/- BMI 1.5 SDS relative to birth weight / length).</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">•	Other known short stature syndrome
•	Causative UPD (including UPD7, UPD14, UPD16, UPD20)
•	Causative chromosome rearrangement
•	Isolated methylation defect other than in familial cases</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">UPD7 testing and 11p15 methylation testing are required PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT as molecular diagnosis determines eligibility and methylation abnormalities cannot be detected on WGS. 

Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:

- Multi-locus methylation testing</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001511" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intrauterine growth retardation</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormal restriction of fetal growth with fetal weight below the tenth percentile for gestational age.

Comment:
Intrauterine growth restriction is a newer term that is preferred over Intrauterine growth retardation. The causes of IUGR include maternal abnormalities (chronic hypertension, cyanotic heart disease, smoking, drug abuse), placental or umbilical cord abnormalities (including placenta previa and cord anomalies), maternal medicationas, and genetic disorders of the fetus.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001562" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Oligohydramnios</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Diminished amniotic fluid volume in pregnancy.

Comment:
Oligohydramnios is the opposite of polyhydramnios. In normal pregnancy the amniotic fluid volume increases by about 10 ml/day until the 34th, after which it slowly diminishes. A normal amniotic fluid volume at term is about 500-2,000 ml. Oligohydramnios is defined as an AFI (amniotic fluid index) less than 5 cm or smallest vertical pocket of fluid less than 2 cm.</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Failure to thrive (FTT) refers to a child whose physical growth is substantially below the norm.

Comment:
Although there is no clear consensus on the exact definition of FTT, it is usually diagnoses in a child growing below the 3rd percentile or in a child whose decreased growth has cross two major growth percentiles (for example, from above the 75th percentile to below the 25th percentile).</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A relatively mild degree of macrocephaly in which the head circumference is not above two standard deviations from the mean, but appears dysproportionately large when other factors such as body stature are taken into account.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011220" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Prominent forehead</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Forward prominence of the entire forehead, due to protrusion of the frontal bone.

Comment:
Not to be confused with frontal bossing.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000175" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft palate</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Cleft palate is a developmental defect of the palate resulting from a failure of fusion of the palatine processes and manifesting as a separation of the roof of the mouth (soft and hard palate).

Comment:
Cleft palate is a developmental defect that occurs between the 7th and 12th week of pregnancy. Normally, the palatine processes fuse during this time to form the soft and hard palate. A failure of fusion results in a cleft palate. The clinical spectrum ranges from bifid uvula, to (incomplete or complete) cleft of the soft palate, up to (complete or incomplete) cleft of both the soft and hard palate.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000347" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Micrognathia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Developmental hypoplasia of the mandible.

Comment:
Mandibular hypoplasia, also known as micrognathia, is a term that describes an abnormally small lower jaw.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004322" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short stature</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A height below that which is expected according to age and gender norms. Although there is no universally accepted definition of short stature, many refer to &quot;short stature&quot; as height more than 2 standard deviations below the mean for age and gender (or below the 3rd percentile for age and gender dependent norms).</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004209" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Clinodactyly of the 5th finger</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Clinodactyly refers to a bending or curvature of the fifth finger in the radial direction (i.e., towards the 4th finger).

Comment:
Minor degrees of curvature of the small finger are so common as to be considered normal.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001156" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Brachydactyly syndrome</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Digits that appear disproportionately short compared to the hand/foot. The word brachydactyly is used to describe a series of Mendelian diseases characterized by distinct patterns of shortened digits (brachydactyly types A-E). This is the sense used here, however, it is preferable to described the observed phenotypic abnormalities precisely.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100490" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Camptodactyly of finger</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">The distal interphalangeal joint and/or the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fingers cannot be extended to 180 degrees by either active or passive extension.

Comment:
Note that some restrict the use of the term to inability to extend the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fifth finger. We do not restrict the term in this way. This term should not be used if the patient has Clenched hand. A similar effect can be created by radial angulation within the distal phalanx with thickening of the epiphysis, which is called Kirner deformity or dystelephalangy. The affected digits should be specified.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000126" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hydronephrosis</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Severe distention of the kidney with dilation of the renal pelvis and calices.

Comment:
Hydronephrosis can be caused by reflux or by retrograde pressure on the kidney when the flow of urine is obstructed.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000054" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Micropenis</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormally small penis. At birth, the normal penis is about 3 cm (stretched length from pubic tubercle to tip of penis) with micropenis less than 2.0-2.5 cm.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000047" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypospadias</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Displacement of the urethral opening on the ventral (inferior) surface of the penis.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000028" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cryptorchidism</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testis in inguinal canal. That is, absence of one or both testes from the scrotum owing to failure of the testis or testes to descend through the inguinal canal to the testis.

Comment:
The gonad is mobile and can be retracted superiorly by the cremaster muscle reflex stimulated, for instance, by cold or touch. A retracted testis is not cryptorchidism. An abdominal testis cannot be distinguished by physical examination from an (Apparently) absent testis and requires radiological (or, rarely, surgical) procedures for assessment.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.

Comment:
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term &#39;psychomotor retardation&#39; is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.

Comment:
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000238" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hydrocephalus</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Hydrocephalus is an active distension of the ventricular system of the brain resulting from inadequate passage of CSF from its point of production within the cerebral ventricles to its point of absorption into the systemic circulation.

Comment:
Hydrocephalus results from an imbalance between the rate of production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), mainly in the choroid plexus, and its reabsorption in the subarchnoid space over brain and spinal cord.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000957" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cafe-au-lait spot</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Cafe-au-lait spots are hyperpigmented lesions that can vary in color from light brown to dark brown with smooth borders and having a size of 1.5 cm or more in adults and 0.5 cm or more in children.

Comment:
The phrase cafe-au-lait comes from the French word for milk-coffee. A single cafe-au-lait spot can be an isolated finding in otherwise normal individuals. Multiple cafe-au-lait spots often indicate the presence of neurofibromatosis type 1 but may also be seen in other diseases including McCune-Albright syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Fanconi anemia.</p>
