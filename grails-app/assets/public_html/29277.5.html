<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
A. One or more of: <br />
    - Renal hypodysplasia or agenesis <br />
    - Congenital multicystic kidney <br />
    - Congenital, persistent, severe hydroureter <br />
    - Congenital, persistent, severe congenital hydronephrosis <br />
    - Bladder exstrophy <br />
    In the presence or absence of family history or other features<br />
OR<br />
B.  One or more of:<br />
    - Duplex kidney<br />
    - Vesicoureteric reflux<br />
    - Vesicoureteric or ureteropelvic junction obstruction<br />
    - Posterior urethral valves<br />
    AND<br />
    - Syndromic disease  OR<br />
    - Family history of CAKUT<br />
<br />
AND (for A. or B.)<br />
- Unaffected individuals have undergone appropriate investigation for cryptic disease e.g. renal ultrasound scan<br />
- Individuals with severe or syndromic disease should be recruited according to standard guidance, preferably as trios<br />
- In other cases, unaffected individuals should not be recruited. Recruitment in such families should favour multiplex families over single isolated cases. These singleton recruits will not contribute to the overall singleton monitoring metrics applied to GMCs.

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
C.  Clinical or molecular diagnosis of autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease<br />
D.  Known causative genetic or chromosomal abnormality

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
- HNF1B if personal or family history of diabetes mellitus<br />
  - SALL1 if 2 out of imperforate anus, ear abnormalities, thumb abnormalities

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

						<!-- <h2>CAKUT Phenotypes</h2> -->

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100542" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal localization of kidney</a></h3>
	An abnormal site of the kidney.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000014" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the bladder</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the urinary bladder.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000795" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the urethra</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the urethra, i.e., of the tube which connects the urinary bladder to the outside of the body.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000079" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the urinary system</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the urinary system.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010958" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Bilateral renal agenesis</a></h3>
	A bilateral form of agenesis of the kidney.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002836" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Bladder exstrophy</a></h3>
	Eversion of the posterior bladder wall through the congenitally absent lower anterior abdominal wall and anterior bladder wall <br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Exstrophy of the bladder can be associated with Epispadias and Bifid penis or in females with Bifid clitoris, a bifid uterus, and a Septated vagina, each of which should be coded separately.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012620" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cloacal abnormality</a></h3>
	A developmental anomaly associated with the failure of rectum, vagina, and bladder to separate.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008676" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Congenital megaureter</a></h3>
	A developmental disturbance with extreme ureteral dilatation.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The cause of congenital megaloureter is thought to be aperistalsis of the distal ureter, leading to dilatation. The defect in peristalsis may be due to faulty development of muscle layers of ureter, that is, there is a functional, not a mechanical cause of obstruction.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010957" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Congenital posterior urethral valve</a></h3>
	A developmental defect resulting in an obstructing membrane in the posterior male urethra.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Congenital posterior urethral valve is a cause of bladder outlet obstruction in male newborns. It results from a failure of resorption of the caudal end of the Wolffian duct into the primitive cloaca at the site of the future verumontanum in the posterior urethra (Following normal resorption of the posterior urethral valve there remain the posterior urethral folds, also called plicae colliculi).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004736" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Crossed fused renal ectopia</a></h3>
	A developmental anomaly in which the kidneys are fused and localized on the same side of the midline. This anomaly is thought to result from disruption of the normal embryologic migration of the kidneys.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000028" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cryptorchidism</a></h3>
	Testis in inguinal canal. That is, absence of one or both testes from the scrotum owing to failure of the testis or testes to descend through the inguinal canal to the testis.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The gonad is mobile and can be retracted superiorly by the cremaster muscle reflex stimulated, for instance, by cold or touch. A retracted testis is not cryptorchidism. An abdominal testis cannot be distinguished by physical examination from an (Apparently) absent testis and requires radiological (or, rarely, surgical) procedures for assessment.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000800" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cystic renal dysplasia</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010946" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dilatation of the renal pelvis</a></h3>
	The presence of dilatation of the renal pelvis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000081" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Duplicated collecting system</a></h3>
	A duplication of the collecting system of the kidney.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000086" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ectopic kidney</a></h3>
	A developmental defect in which a kidney is located in an abnormal anatomic position.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000085" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Horseshoe kidney</a></h3>
	A connection of the right and left kidney by an isthmus of functioning renal parenchyma or fibrous tissue that crosses the midline.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000126" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hydronephrosis</a></h3>
	Severe distention of the kidney with dilation of the renal pelvis and calices.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hydronephrosis can be caused by reflux or by retrograde pressure on the kidney when the flow of urine is obstructed.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000072" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hydroureter</a></h3>
	The distention of the ureter with urine.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000047" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypospadias</a></h3>
	Displacement of the urethral opening on the ventral (inferior) surface of the penis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000021" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Megacystis</a></h3>
	Dilatation of the bladder postnatally.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000003" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Multicystic kidney dysplasia</a></h3>
	Multicystic dysplasia of the kidney is characterized by multiple cysts of varying size in the kidney and the absence of a normal pelvocaliceal system. The condition is associated with ureteral or ureteropelvic atresia, and the affected kidney is nonfunctional.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Multicystic kidney dysplasia is the result of abnormal fetal renal development in which the affected kidney is replaced by multiple cysts and has little or no residual function. The vast majority of multicystic kidneys are unilateral. Multicystic kidney can be diagnosed on prenatal ultrasound.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000090" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Nephronophthisis</a></h3>
	Presence of cysts at the corticomedullary junction of the kidney in combination with tubulointerstitial fibrosis.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Nephronophthisis is here regarded as a phenotypic feature. The disease of the same name results in progressive symmetrical destruction of the kidneys involving both the tubules and glomeruli.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000113" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Polycystic kidney dysplasia</a></h3>
	The presence of multiple cysts in both kidneys.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Most commonly, PKD arises as an inherited trait. Tremendous enlargement of both kidneys is characteristic of the autosomal dominant form of PKD, with up to hundreds or thousands of renal cysts. This term does not refer to the disease entity but rather to the finding of numerous cysts in both kidneys.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000104" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Renal agenesis</a></h3>
	Agenesis, that is, failure of the kidney to develop during embryogenesis and development.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Renal agenesis can occur as a unilateral or bilateral trait.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000075" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Renal duplication</a></h3>
	A congenital anomaly of the urinary tract, in which the kidney is duplicated and is drained via two separate renal pelves and ureters.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000110" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Renal dysplasia</a></h3>
	The presence of developmental dysplasia of the kidney.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000089" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Renal hypoplasia</a></h3>
	Hypoplasia of the kidney.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Oligomeganephronic renal hypoplasia differs from simple hypoplasia, in which the renal mass is reduced but the number of nephrons is normal.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000122" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Unilateral renal agenesis</a></h3>
	A unilateral form of agenesis of the kidney.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008718" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Unilateral renal dysplasia</a></h3>
	A unilateral form of developmental dysplasia of the kidney.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000073" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ureteral duplication</a></h3>
	A developmental anomaly characterized by the presence of two, instead of one, ureter connecting a kidney to the bladder.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000070" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ureterocele</a></h3>
	A ureterocele is a congenital saccular dilatation of the distal segment of the ureter.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008631" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ureteral dysgenesis</a></h3>
	A developmental anomaly of the ureter.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
If possible, a more specific term describing the precise type of ureteral dysgenesis should be chosen.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000074" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ureteropelvic junction obstruction</a></h3>
	Blockage of urine flow from the renal pelvis to the proximal ureter.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008714" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ureterovesical stenosis</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010481" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Urethral valve</a></h3>
	The presence of an abnormal membrane obstructing the urethra.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100779" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Urogenital sinus anomaly</a></h3>
	A rare birth defect in women where the urethra and vagina both open into a common channel.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000076" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Vesicoureteral reflux</a></h3>
	Abnormal (retrograde) movement of urine from the bladder into ureters or kidneys related to inadequacy of the valvular mechanism at the ureterovesicular junction or other causes.

Complete labioscrotal fusion forming a urogenital sinus with a single opening. Prader 4: Complete scrotal fusion with urogenital opening at the base or on the shaft of the phallus. Prader 5: Normal male external genitalia. The diagnosis of ambiguous genitalia is made for Prader 1-4.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Note that this term can include or combine variations in size and shape, with partial or complete absence of structures. It is preferable to describe the individual components, which are defined below. It is nonetheless a widely used bundled term and as such is retained here. The distinction of this finding from a marked degree of Hypospadias is an example of how this term can be problematic. Genetic gender is determined at fertilization, whereby the presence of a Y chromosome determines male gender. Normally, genetic gender determines gonadal gender which in turn determines phenotypic gender. Testicular development is an active process requiring expression of the primary testis determining gene SRY, which is located on the Y chromosome.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000458" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anosmia</a></h3>
	An inability to perceive odors. This is a general term describing inability to smell arising in any part of the process of smelling from absorption of odorants into the nasal mucous overlying the olfactory epithelium, diffusion to the cilia, binding to olfactory receptor sites, generation of action potentials in olfactory neurons, and perception of a smell.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009794" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Branchial anomaly</a></h3>
	Congenital developmental defect arising from the primitive branchial apparatus.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
During embryonic development the major head and neck structures are formed from the five pharyngeal arches (bands of tissue). Incomplete, failed or persistent embryonic development of these arches results in several anomalies or defects in the neck.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000819" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Diabetes mellitus</a></h3>
	A group of abnormalities characterized by hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000356" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the outer ear</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the external ear.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001999" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal facial shape</a></h3>
	An abnormal morphology (form) of the face or its components.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term now covers many of the historical inexact descriptions such as Bird-like facies that probably should be avoided in modern genetics. This portion of the Ontology should be revised.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
	A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000135" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypogonadism</a></h3>
	A decreased functionality of the gonad.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Reduced functioning of the gonads (ovaries or testes) with reduced production of sex hormones.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000478" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the eye</a></h3>
	Any abnormality of the eye, including location, spacing, and intraocular abnormalities.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001696" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Situs inversus totalis</a></h3>
	A left-right reversal (or "mirror reflection") of the anatomical location of the major thoracic and abdominal organs.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000039" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Epispadias</a></h3>
	Displacement of the urethral opening on the dorsal (superior) surface of the penis.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Epispadias may be present in a phenotypic male, female, or an individual with ambiguous genitalia. A meatus in a phenotypic male may be positioned either on the glans (glandular or balanic epispadias), the shaft (penile epispadias) or at the attachment of the penis to the abdominal wall (penopubic epispadias). Alternatively, the urethra may be an open groove along the dorsal shaft of the penis, with no readily recognized meatus. Epispadias is a frequent component of Bladder exstrophy, but should be coded separately.
