						<!-- <h2>Skeletal Muscle Channelopathies Eligibility</h2> -->


<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Episodic flaccid paralysis or weakness and/or myotonia<br />
- May develop progressive, usually proximal, weakness<br />
- Electrophysiology including long and short exercise testing <br />
- Intra-attack potassium documented whenever possible<br />
- Normal renal function and thyroid function

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<br />
<br />
- Primary renal or endocrine problem that may be causative<br />
- Associated loss of consciousness with attacks

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken. This includes review of available exome sequencing data, but where this is the case can be limited to genes specified within disease-relevant in silico panels. The patient is not eligible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in any gene related to their phenotype.<br />
- Standard local genetic testing and nationally commissioned testing for this phenotype should have been completed AND<br />
- Testing should be undertaken for any individual gene for which diagnostic yield is >10% for this phenotype AND<br />
- The following specific gene tests are advised as a means of limiting the re-discovery of recognised pathogenic variants that could be more efficiently identified through the existing catalogue of UKGTN tests:

<h3>Genes</h3>
- Myotonia: DMPK, CNBP, SCN4A, CLCN1 (including MLPA)<br />
 - Episodic weakness: CACNA1S, SCN4A, KCNJ2

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

						<!-- <h2>MCP Phenotypes</h2> -->

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003768" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Periodic paralysis</a></h3>
	Episodes of muscle weakness.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002131" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Episodic ataxia</a></h3>
	Periodic spells of incoordination and imbalance, that is, episodes of ataxia typically lasting from 10 minutes to several hours or days.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001324" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Muscle weakness</a></h3>
	Reduced strength of muscles.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
It is important clinical to distinguish between muscle weakness, fatigue, and asthenia. Fatigue describes the inability to continue performing a task after multiple repetitions; in contrast, a patient with primary weakness is unable to perform the first repetition of the task. Asthenia is a sense of weariness or exhaustion in the absence of muscle weakness. Conditions that result in intrinsic muscle weakness can be divided into several main categories: infectious, neurologic, endocrine, inflammatory, rheumatologic, genetic, metabolic, electrolyte-induced, or drug-induced.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002486" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Myotonia</a></h3>
	An involuntary and painless delay in the relaxation of skeletal muscle following contraction or electrical stimulation.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Patients often describe myotonia as stiffness that is worse at the onset of activity and that improves with repeated muscle contractions. Myotonia tends to worsen in cold weather. Myotonia can be elicited by voluntary muscle contraction of by muscle percussion (e.g., by tapping the thenar eminence). During physical examination, myotonia may be elicited by asking the patient to make a tight fist and then quickly open the hand. Myotonia is caused by an abnormality in the muscle membrane, i.e., of the ion channels that control the contraction of muscle fibers.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003740" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Myotonia with warm-up phenomenon</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003323" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Progressive muscle weakness</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002411" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Myokymia</a></h3>
	Successive and rapid contractions of motor units associated with chronic nerve injury. The discharges arise from the peripheral aspects of regenerating nerves, and clinically impart a nearly continuous undulation of the body surface overlying the muscle.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002076" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Migraine</a></h3>
	Migraine is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by episodic attacks of headache and associated symptoms.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002077" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Migraine with aura</a></h3>
	A type of migraine in which there is an aura characterized by focal neurological phenomena that usually proceed, but may accompany or occur in the absence of, the headache. The symptoms of an aura may include fully reversible visual, sensory, and speech symptoms but not motor weakness. Visual symptoms may include flickering lights, spots and lines and/or loss of vision and/or unilateral sensory symptoms such as paresthesias or numbness. At least one of the symptoms of an aura develops gradually over 5 or more minutes and/or different symptoms occur in succession.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002083" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Migraine without aura</a></h3>
	Repeated headache attacks lasting 4-72 h fulfilling at least two of the following criteria: 1) unilateral location, 2) pulsating quality, 3) moderate or severe pain intensity, and 4) aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity such as climbing stairs. Headache attacks are commonly accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The definition of this term is based on the definition in the International Classification of Headache Disorders by the International Headache Society (pmid:15304572), which additionally stipulate that such headaches must have occurred at least five times and not other secondary cause must be apparent in order to make the diagnosis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001657" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Prolonged QT interval</a></h3>
	Increased time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave as measured by the electrocardiogram (EKG).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The QT interval represents electrical depolarization and repolarization of the left and right ventricles.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003457" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">EMG abnormality</a></h3>
	Abnormal results of investigations using electromyography (EMG).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011805" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of muscle morphology</a></h3>
	A structural abnormality of a skeletal muscle.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002011" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Morphological abnormality of the central nervous system</a></h3>
	A structural abnormality of the central nervous system.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004322" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short stature</a></h3>
	A height below that which is expected according to age and gender norms. Although there is no universally accepted definition of short stature, many refer to "short stature" as height more than 2 standard deviations below the mean for age and gender (or below the 3rd percentile for age and gender dependent norms).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001999" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormal facial shape</a></h3>
	An abnormal morphology (form) of the face or its components.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term now covers many of the historical inexact descriptions such as Bird-like facies that probably should be avoided in modern genetics. This portion of the Ontology should be revised.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002814" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the lower limb</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the leg.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002817" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the upper limb</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the arm.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010496" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypertrophy of the lower limb</a></h3>
	Abnormal increase in size of the lower limbs (due to an increase of the size of cells).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010484" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypertrophy of the upper limb</a></h3>
	Abnormal increase in size of the upper limbs (due to an increase of the size of cells).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009055" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Generalized limb muscle atrophy</a></h3>
	Generalized (unlocalized) atrophy affecting muscles of the limbs in both proximal and distal locations.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010548" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Percussion myotonia</a></h3>
	A localized myotonic contraction in a muscle in reaction to percussion (tapping with the examiner's finger, a rubber percussion hammer, or a similar object).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001315" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Reduced tendon reflexes</a></h3>
	Diminution of tendon reflexes, which is an invariable sign of peripheral nerve disease.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The deep tendon reflex is a monosynaptic reflex arc with sensory and motor nerve components, but the arc is much more vulnerable to sensory nerve damage. Ankle plantar flexion is retained in all but the most severe peripheral neuropathies, and thus loss of the Achilles tendon reflex in an objective indication of a substantial sensory nerve defect.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001348" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Brisk reflexes</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001284" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Areflexia</a></h3>
	Absence of neurologic reflexes such as the knee-jerk reaction.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The strectch reflexes (also called deep tendon relfexes) include the knee-jerk reflex (patellar reflex, the biceps reflex, the triceps reflex, and the ankle jerk reflex or Achilles tendon reflex).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001288" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Gait disturbance</a></h3>
	The term gait disturbance can refer to any disruption of the ability to walk. In general, this can refer to neurological diseases but also fractures or other sources of pain that is triggered upon walking. However, in the current context gait disturbance refers to difficulty walking on the basis of a neurological or muscular disease.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
If possible, this term should not be used for new annotations. Rather, a more specific term should be sought.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003236" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Elevated serum creatine phosphokinase</a></h3>
	An elevation of the level of the enzyme creatine kinase (also known as creatine phosphokinase, CPK; EC 2.7.3.2) in the blood. CPK levels can be elevated in a number of clinical disorders such as myocardial infarction, rhabdomyolysis, and muscular dystrophy.
