  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Anorexia nervosa restricting or binge/purge type 
- Duration of &gt;5 years 
- At least one first- or two second- degree relative affected 
- Minimum BMI of 16 kg/m2 
- Maintenance of low BMI 
- Other indices of starvation may be present such as amenorrhea (in women), lanugo, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoleptinemia,  

The optimal family structure for Severe familial anorexia is to recruit the affected proband, their parents, and any affected siblings; outside this structure, no other unaffected relatives should be recruited.</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Acute onset after head injury
- Primary Adrenal insufficiency, Crohns, inflammatory bowel disease, cealiac disease, ulcerative colitis</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 No genes listed</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

Comment:
Brittle is used to describe hair which is very short because of an abnormality is in the structure of the shaft. Microscopically the ends appear fractured. Affected patients may report bits of hair on the collar or pillow. Brittle hair can be distinguished from hypotrichosis due to slow or deficient growth (e.g., due to hypotrichosis simplex) and hypotrichosis due to the hair being fine and soft where the hair just wears out too quickly (e.g., due to ectodermal dysplasia).</p>

    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A type of weakness that occurs after a muscle group is used and lessens if the muscle group has some rest. That is, there is diminution of strength with repetitive muscle actions.

Comment:
This type of weakness is pathognomonic for an abnormality of the neuromuscular junction such as myasthenia gravis. A characteristic form of muscular weakness that worsens after use of affected muscles. Myasthenia is caused by  failure of neuromuscular transmission, which results from the binding of autoantibodies to proteins involved in signaling at the neuromuscular junction, including especially the nicotinic acetyl choline receptor (AChR) or, less frequently, a muscle-specific tyrosine kinase involved in AChR clustering.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100753" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Schizophrenia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A mental disorder characterized by a disintegration of thought processes and of emotional responsiveness. It most commonly manifests as auditory hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions, or disorganized speech and thinking, and it is accompanied by significant social or occupational dysfunction. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in young adulthood, with a global lifetime prevalence of about 0.3-0.7%.

Comment:
Positive symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations (especially of voices), are common, and any Schneiderian first-rank symptoms are particularly indicative of the illness. Negative symptoms include social withdrawal, impairment of ego boundaries, and loss of energy and initiative. Schizophrenia is diagnosed only if symptoms persist for at least one month. The illness can spontaneously remit, run a course with infrequent or frequent relapses, or become chronic. The prognosis has improved with antipsychotic drugs and with vigorous psychological and social management and rehabilitation. The many causes include genetic factors, environmental stress, and various triggering factors.</p>

Comment:
Headache is one of the most common types of recurrent pain as well as one of the most frequent symptoms in neurology. In addition to occasional headaches, there are well-defined headache disorders that vary in incidence, prevalence and duration and can be divided into two broad categories. In secondary headache disorders, headaches are attributed to another condition, such as brain tumour or head injury; for the primary disorders the headache is not due to another condition.</p>
