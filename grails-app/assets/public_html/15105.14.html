<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
- Hypoglycaemia onset before 12 years of age<br />
- Drug-treated for >=3 months or pancreatectomy<br />
- Intravenous glucose infusion rate required to maintain normoglycaemia >8mg/kg/min<br />
- Detectable serum insulin or C-Peptide when blood glucose is less than 3mmol/L

<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
- Hypoglycaemia in the neonatal period which resolved without treatment<br />
- Hypoglycaemia in the context of systemic neonatal disease e.g. sepsis

<h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. <br />
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.

<h3>Genes</h3>
 

<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000842" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperinsulinemia</a></h3>
	An increased concentration of insulin in the blood.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000825" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia</a></h3>
	An increased concentration of insulin combined with a decreased concentration of glucose in the blood.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia describes a situation in which the level of insulin is inappropriate for the low level of blood sugar.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001520" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Large for gestational age</a></h3>
	The term large for gestational age applies to babies whose birth weight lies above the 90th percentile for that gestational age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Fetal macrosomia has been defined in several different ways, including birth weight of 4000-4500 g (8 lb 13 oz to 9 lb 15 oz) or greater than 90% for gestational age after correcting for neonatal sex and ethnicity. Based on these definitions, macrosomia affects 1-10% of all pregnancies. A diagnosis of fetal macrosomia can be made only by measuring birth weight after delivery; therefore, the condition is confirmed only retrospectively, ie, after delivery of the neonate.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001987" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hyperammonemia</a></h3>
	An increased concentration of ammonia in the blood.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001939" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001548" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Overgrowth</a></h3>
	Excessive postnatal growth which may comprise increased weight, increased length, and/or increased head circumference.
