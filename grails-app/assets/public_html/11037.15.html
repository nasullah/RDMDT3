  <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>

  <h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- History of episodic photosensitivity;
- No evidence of an alternative cause of photosensitivity;
- Onset of symptoms &gt;60 mins after sun exposure and/or atypical symptoms compared to classical EPP photosensitivity and/or resolution of symptoms &lt;48 hours
- Raised red cell free protoporphyrin concentration</p>

  <h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Normal red cell protoporphyrin concentration</p>

  <h3>Prior Genetic Testing</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">- Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition. 
- Genetic testing should continue according to routine local practice for this phenotype regardless of recruitment to the project; results of these tests must be submitted via the ‘Genetic investigations’ section of the data capture tool to allow comparison of WGS with current standard testing.  

PLEASE NOTE: The sensitivity of WGS compared to current diagnostic genetic testing has not yet been established. It is therefore important that tests which are clinically indicated under local standard practice continue to be carried out.</p>

  <h3>Genes</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:
 - FECH</p>

  <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
  <p class="preserve-new-lines">These requirements will be kept under continual review during the main programme and may be subject to change.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012187" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Increased erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentration</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An increased concentration of protoporphyrins in erythrocytes.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000992" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cutaneous photosensitivity</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An increased sensitivity of the skin to light. Photosensitivity may result in a rash upon exposure to the sun (which is known as photodermatosis). Photosensitivity can be diagnosed by phototests in which light is shone on small areas of skin.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000982" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Palmoplantar keratoderma</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Abnormal thickening of the skin of the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000969" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Edema</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormal accumulation of fluid beneath the skin, or in one or more cavities of the body.

Comment:
Edema may be related to one or more of the following factors: 1) increased capillary hydrostatic pressure, 2) decreased osmotic pressure of plasma, 3) decreased tissue tension and lymphatic drainage, 4) increased osmotic pressure of tissue fluids, and 5) increased capillary permeability.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001935" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcytic anemia</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A kind of anemia in which the volume of the red blood cells is reduced.

Comment:
In normocytic anemia, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is below normal limits (&gt;80 fl in adults).</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001080" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Biliary tract abnormality</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">An abnormality of the biliary tree.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001081" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cholelithiasis</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Hard, pebble-like deposits that form within the gallbladder.

Comment:
Gallstones range in size from as small as a grain of sand to as large as a golf ball. Cholesterol gallstones are the most common type of gallstone. Gallstones resulting from too much bilirubin in the bile are referred to as pigment stones.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001399" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hepatic failure</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines"></p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001394" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cirrhosis</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">A chronic disorder of the liver in which liver tissue becomes scarred and is partially replaced by regenerative nodules and fibrotic tissue resulting in loss of liver function.

Comment:
Cirrhosis is caused by chronic liver disease as a result of viral infections (hepatitis), alcohol abuse, certain medications, certain metabolic disorders of iron and copper, and many others. Cirrhosis may lead to a number of abnormalities including hepatomegaly, jaundice, abnormal liver function tests, ascites, dilatation of veins in the abdominal wall, anemia, and clotting deficiencies.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001396" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cholestasis</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Impairment of bile flow due to obstruction in bile ducts.</p>
  
    <h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002910" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Elevated hepatic transaminases</a></h3>
    <p class="preserve-new-lines">Elevations of the levels of SGOT and SGPT in the serum. SGOT (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase) and SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase) are transaminases primarily found in the liver and heart and are released into the bloodstream as the result of liver or heart damage. SGOT and SGPT are used clinically mainly as markers of liver damage.</p>
