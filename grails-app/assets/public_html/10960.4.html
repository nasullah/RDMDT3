						<!-- <h2>Kabuki Phenotypes</h2> -->

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001531" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Failure to thrive in infancy</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004325" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Decreased body weight</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001513" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Obesity</a></h3>
	Body weight that is grossly above the acceptable or desirable weight, usually due to accumulation of excess fats in the body. The standards may vary with age, sex, genetic or cultural background. In the body mass index (BMI), a BMI greater than 30.0 kg/m2 is considered obese, and a BMI greater than 40.0 kg/m2 is considered morbidly obese.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002958" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Immune dysregulation</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008897" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Postnatal growth retardation</a></h3>
	Slow or limited growth after birth.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000028" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cryptorchidism</a></h3>
	Testis in inguinal canal. That is, absence of one or both testes from the scrotum owing to failure of the testis or testes to descend through the inguinal canal to the testis.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The gonad is mobile and can be retracted superiorly by the cremaster muscle reflex stimulated, for instance, by cold or touch. A retracted testis is not cryptorchidism. An abdominal testis cannot be distinguished by physical examination from an (Apparently) absent testis and requires radiological (or, rarely, surgical) procedures for assessment.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002721" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Immunodeficiency</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000074" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ureteropelvic junction obstruction</a></h3>
	Blockage of urine flow from the renal pelvis to the proximal ureter.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000054" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Micropenis</a></h3>
	Abnormally small penis. At birth, the normal penis is about 3 cm (stretched length from pubic tubercle to tip of penis) with micropenis less than 2.0-2.5 cm.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005218" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anoperineal fistula</a></h3>
	The presence of a fistula (abnormal tunnel) between the anal canal and the perineum.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004736" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Crossed fused renal ectopia</a></h3>
	A developmental anomaly in which the kidneys are fused and localized on the same side of the midline. This anomaly is thought to result from disruption of the normal embryologic migration of the kidneys.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000218" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">High palate</a></h3>
	Height of the palate more than 2 SD above the mean (objective) or palatal height at the level of the first permanent molar more than twice the height of the teeth (subjective).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The measuring device for this assessment is described in (Hall JG, Froster-Iskenius UG, Allanson JE, Gripp K, Slavotinek A. 2006. Handbook of Normal Physical Measurements. 2nd edition. Oxford Medical, publishers). A high palate is often associated with a narrow palate. However, a narrow palate can easily give a false appearance of a high palate. Height and width of the palate should be assessed and coded separately. We do not recommend the subjective determination because this term can be overused and<br />
applied inaccurately.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000164" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the teeth</a></h3>
	Any abnormality of the teeth.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Any abnormality of the primary (deciduous) or permanent teeth.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000437" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Depressed nasal tip</a></h3>
	Decreased distance from the nasal tip to the nasal base.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This often accompanies a Short columella, Overhanging nasal tip, and Underdeveloped nasal tip, but these should be assessed and coded separately.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000431" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Wide nasal bridge</a></h3>
	Increased breadth of the nasal bridge (and with it, the nasal root).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Care should be taken to distinguish between increased width of bone and Fullness of paranasal tissue. A wide nasal bridge should be distinguished from Telecanthus and Hypertelorism. A wide nasal bridge can be either prominent or depressed, which should be coded separately.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000455" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Broad nasal tip</a></h3>
	Increase in width of the nasal tip.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Nasal tip width is assessed at the anterior junction of the alae and the tip. This is easier in persons with a somewhat squared shape of the nasal tip. This may be best viewed from the inferior aspect of the nose. No objective measures are available. See Bulbous nose for a related term.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000527" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Long eyelashes</a></h3>
	Mid upper eyelash length >10 mm or increased length of the eyelashes (subjective).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Measurement should be done on the longest lashes, which are usually at the center of the lid. Normal values are 7.99 - 1.05 mm in boys and 7.76 - 1.03 mm in girls.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000535" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sparse eyebrow</a></h3>
	Decreased density/number and/or decreased diameter of eyebrow hairs.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Sparseness can be regional (medial, central, lateral) or total. These modifiers should be incorporated into the term, when appropriate.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000637" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Long palpebral fissure</a></h3>
	Distance between medial and lateral canthi is more than two standard deviations above the mean for age (objective); or, apparently increased length of the palpebral fissures.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000689" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Dental malocclusion</a></h3>
	Dental malocclusion refers to an abnormality of the occlusion, or alignment, of the teeth and the way the upper and lower teeth fit together, resulting in overcrowding of teeth or in abnormal bite patterns.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002000" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short columella</a></h3>
	Reduced distance from the anterior border of the naris to the subnasale.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This is often accompanied by a Depressed nasal tip but this should be assessed and coded separately. The term Absent columella has been deleted because a columella is thought to always be present, except in Single naris and Proboscis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002553" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Highly arched eyebrow</a></h3>
	Increased height of the central portion of the eyebrow, forming a crescent, semicircular, or inverted U shape.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Most eyebrows have some arch with downturning medially and laterally.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000159" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the lip</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the lip.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005338" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Sparse lateral eyebrow</a></h3>
	Decreased density/number and/or decreased diameter of lateral eyebrow hairs.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Abnormal sparseness of the eyebrows laterally.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007655" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Eversion of lateral third of lower eyelids</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000378" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cupped ear</a></h3>
	Laterally protruding ear that lacks antihelical folding (including absence of inferior and superior crura).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000592" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Blue sclerae</a></h3>
	An abnormal bluish coloration of the sclera.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000400" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Macrotia</a></h3>
	Median longitudinal ear length greater than two standard deviations above the mean and median ear width greater than two standard deviations above the mean (objective); or, apparent increase in length and width of the pinna (subjective).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This is acknowledged to be a bundled term but retained here because of its usefulness in practice. Ear length is determined by the maximal distance from the superior aspect to the inferior aspect of the external ear. If only length is increased the term Long ear should be used.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000403" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Recurrent otitis media</a></h3>
	Increased susceptibility to otitis media, as manifested by recurrent episodes of otitis media.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004467" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Preauricular pit</a></h3>
	Small indentation anterior to the insertion of the ear.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Preauricular cysts and sinuses are ectodermal remnants from an aberrant development of the auditory tubercles, tend to be bilateral and are localized anterior to the tragus of the ear. The preauricular sinus is a benign congenital lesion of the preauricular soft tissue consisting of a blind-ending narrow tube or pit. It is also known as preauricular pit, preauricular fistula, preauricular tract and preauricular cyst. It can be asymptomatic or present as an infected and discharging sinus. It presents as a small pit adjacent to the external ear usually located at the anterior margin of the ascending limb of the helix. The preauricular sinus is variably also termed a preauricular pit, preauricular fistula, preauricular tract and preauricular cyst.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000411" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Protruding ear</a></h3>
	Angle formed by the plane of the ear and the mastoid bone greater than the 97th centile for age (objective); or, outer edge of the helix more than 2 cm from the mastoid at the point of maximum distance (objective).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001249" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intellectual disability</a></h3>
	Subnormal intellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period. Intellectual disability, previously referred to as mental retardation, has been defined as an IQ score below 70.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
This term should be used for children at least five years old. For younger children, consider the term Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011398" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Central hypotonia</a></h3>
	Reduced muscle tone secondary to an abnormality of the central nervous system.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001212" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Prominent fingertip pads</a></h3>
	A soft tissue prominence of the ventral aspects of the fingertips. The term "persistent fetal fingertip pads" is often used as a synonym, but should better not be used because it implies knowledge of history of the patient which often does not exist.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001382" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Joint hypermobility</a></h3>
	The ability of a joint to move beyond its normal range of motion.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001374" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Congenital hip dislocation</a></h3>
	
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009237" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short 5th finger</a></h3>
	Hypoplasia (congenital reduction in size) of the fifth finger, also known as the little finger.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003468" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the vertebrae</a></h3>
	An abnormality of one or more of the vertebrae.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
A vertebra is one of 33 bony segments that form the spinal column of humans. There are 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral and 4 coccygeal vertebrae (the coccygeal vertebrae are fused into one coccyx bone).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004209" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Clinodactyly of the 5th finger</a></h3>
	Clinodactyly refers to a bending or curvature of the fifth finger in the radial direction (i.e., towards the 4th finger).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Minor degrees of curvature of the small finger are so common as to be considered normal.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002023" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anal atresia</a></h3>
	Congenital absence of the anus, i.e., the opening at the bottom end of the intestinal tract.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002024" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Malabsorption</a></h3>
	Impaired ability to absorb one or more nutrients from the intestine.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002025" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Anal stenosis</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002566" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Intestinal malrotation</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the intestinal rotation and fixation that normally occurs during the development of the gut. This can lead to volvulus, or twisting of the intestine that causes obstruction and necrosis.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000957" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cafe-au-lait spot</a></h3>
	Cafe-au-lait spots are hyperpigmented lesions that can vary in color from light brown to dark brown with smooth borders and having a size of 1.5 cm or more in adults and 0.5 cm or more in children.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The phrase cafe-au-lait comes from the French word for milk-coffee. A single cafe-au-lait spot can be an isolated finding in otherwise normal individuals. Multiple cafe-au-lait spots often indicate the presence of neurofibromatosis type 1 but may also be seen in other diseases including McCune-Albright syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Fanconi anemia.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001629" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ventricular septal defect</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001680" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Coarctation of aorta</a></h3>
	Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing or constriction of a segment of the aorta.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Coarctation refers to a narrowing of the lumen of a vessel producing an obstruction to flow. Coarctation can occur in any region of the aorta.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001973" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Autoimmune thrombocytopenia</a></h3>
	The presence of thrombocytopenia in combination with detection of antiplatelet antibodies.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Autoimmune thrombocytopenia is causes by accelerated destruction of auto-antibody sensitized platelets in the reticular-endothelial<br />
system. Common etiologies include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), Drug-induced autoimmune thrombocytopenia, and autoimmune thrombocytopenia following viral infection.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001998" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Neonatal hypoglycemia</a></h3>

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Muscular hypotonia</a></h3>
	Muscular hypotonia is an abnormally low muscle tone (the amount of tension or resistance to movement in a muscle), often involving reduced muscle strength. Hypotonia is characterized by a diminished resistance to passive stretching.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000769" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Abnormality of the breast</a></h3>
	An abnormality of the breast.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010314" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Premature thelarche</a></h3>
	Premature development of the breasts.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000851" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Congenital hypothyroidism</a></h3>
	A type of hypothyroidism with congenital onset.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004322" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Short stature</a></h3>
	A height below that which is expected according to age and gender norms. Although there is no universally accepted definition of short stature, many refer to "short stature" as height more than 2 standard deviations below the mean for age and gender (or below the 3rd percentile for age and gender dependent norms).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000175" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft palate</a></h3>
	Cleft palate is a developmental defect of the palate resulting from a failure of fusion of the palatine processes and manifesting as a separation of the roof of the mouth (soft and hard palate).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Cleft palate is a developmental defect that occurs between the 7th and 12th week of pregnancy. Normally, the palatine processes fuse during this time to form the soft and hard palate. A failure of fusion results in a cleft palate. The clinical spectrum ranges from bifid uvula, to (incomplete or complete) cleft of the soft palate, up to (complete or incomplete) cleft of both the soft and hard palate.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000252" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Microcephaly</a></h3>
	Occipito-frontal (head) circumference (OFC) less than -3 standard deviations compared to appropriate, age matched, normal standards (Ross JJ, Frias JL 1977,  PMID:9683597). Alternatively, decreased size of the cranium.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000204" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Cleft upper lip</a></h3>
	A gap in the upper lip. This is a congenital defect resulting from nonfusion of tissues of the lip during embryonal development.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000668" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hypodontia</a></h3>
	A developmental anomaly characterized by a reduced number of teeth, whereby up to 6 teeth are missing.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hypodontia refers to a reduced number of primary or permanent teeth. Hypodontia may affect either both primary and permanent teeth or only the permanent teeth. Wisdom teeth (the third secondary maxillary and mandibular molar teeth) are not included in this count.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000486" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Strabismus</a></h3>
	Strabismus (also known as squint) is a condition in which the eyes are not properly aligned with each other.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000358" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Posteriorly rotated ears</a></h3>
	A type of abnormal location of the ears in which the position of the ears is characterized by posterior rotation (the superior part of the ears is rotated towards the back of the head, and the inferior part of the ears towards the front).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Angle formed by the line perpendicular to the Frankfurt plane and the medial longitudinal axis of the ear (the two most remote points of the ear) greater than two standard deviations above the mean for age.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000508" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Ptosis</a></h3>
	The upper eyelid margin is positioned 3 mm or more lower than usual and covers the superior portion of the iris (objective); or, the upper lid margin obscures at least part of the pupil (subjective).
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000365" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hearing impairment</a></h3>
	A decreased magnitude of the sensory perception of sound.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. The World Health Organization uses the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.

	Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
The term epilepsy is not used to describe recurrent febrile seizures. Epilepsy presumably reflects an abnormally reduced seizure threshold.
	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001263" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Global developmental delay</a></h3>
	A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age.<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.

	Digits that appear disproportionately short compared to the hand/foot. The word brachydactyly is used to describe a series of Mendelian diseases characterized by distinct patterns of shortened digits (brachydactyly types A-E). This is the sense used here, however, it is preferable to described the observed phenotypic abnormalities precisely.

	<h3><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001878" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Hemolytic anemia</a></h3>
	A type of anemia caused by premature destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis).<br />
<br />
Comment:<br />
Normally, erythrocytes survive on average about 110-120 days. With hemolysis, the erythrocyte survival is shortened, and generally increased marrow activity results in a reticulocyte count.
